# Chapter 4. Getting Started

> If you are getting started with Spring Boot, or "Spring" in general, start by reading this section. It answers the basic "what?", "how?" and "why?" questions. It includes an introduction to Spring Boot, along with installation instructions. We then walk you through building your first Spring Boot application, discussing some core principles as we go.

## Introducing Spring Boot

> Spring Boot helps you to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications that you can run. We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries, so that you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.
>
> You can use Spring Boot to create Java applications that can be started by using java -jar or more traditional war deployments. We also provide a command line tool that runs "spring scripts".
>
> Our primary goals are:

-   Provide a radically faster and widely accessible getting-started experience for all Spring development.

-   Be opinionated out of the box but get out of the way quickly as requirements start to diverge from the defaults.

-   Provide a range of non-functional features that are common to large classes of projects (such as embedded servers, security, metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration).

-   Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration.

## System Requirements

> Spring Boot 2.5.4 requires Java 8 and is compatible up to and including Java 16. Spring Framework
>
> 5.3.9 or above is also required.
>
> Explicit build support is provided for the following build tools:

----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  **Build Tool**                      **Version**

  Maven                               3.5+

  Gradle                              6.8.x, 6.9.x, and 7.x
----------------------------------- -----------------------------------

### 4.2.1. Servlet Containers

> Spring Boot supports the following embedded servlet containers:

----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  **Name**                            **Servlet Version**

  Tomcat 9.0                          4.0
----------------------------------- -----------------------------------

----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  **Name**                            **Servlet Version**

  Jetty 9.4                           3.1

  Jetty 10.0                          4.0

  Undertow 2.0                        4.0
----------------------------------- -----------------------------------

> You can also deploy Spring Boot applications to any Servlet 3.1+ compatible container.

## Installing Spring Boot

> Spring Boot can be used with "classic" Java development tools or installed as a command line tool. Either way, you need Java SDK v1.8 or higher. Before you begin, you should check your current Java installation by using the following command:
>
> If you are new to Java development or if you want to experiment with Spring Boot, you might want to try the [Spring Boot CLI](\l) (Command Line Interface) first. Otherwise, read on for "classic" installation instructions.

### Installation Instructions for the Java Developer

> You can use Spring Boot in the same way as any standard Java library. To do so, include the appropriate spring-boot-\*.jar files on your classpath. Spring Boot does not require any special tools integration, so you can use any IDE or text editor. Also, there is nothing special about a Spring Boot application, so you can run and debug a Spring Boot application as you would any other Java program.
>
> Although you *could* copy Spring Boot jars, we generally recommend that you use a build tool that supports dependency management (such as Maven or Gradle).

##### Maven Installation

> Spring Boot is compatible with Apache Maven 3.3 or above. If you do not already have Maven installed, you can follow the instructions at maven.apache.org.

##### TIP

> On many operating systems, Maven can be installed with a package manager. If you use OSX Homebrew, try brew install maven. Ubuntu users can run sudo apt-get install maven. Windows users with Chocolatey can run choco install maven from an elevated (administrator) prompt.
>
> Spring Boot dependencies use the org.springframework.boot groupId. Typically, your Maven POM file inherits from the spring-boot-starter-parent project and declares dependencies to one or more ["Starters"](\l). Spring Boot also provides an optional [Maven plugin](\l) to create executable jars.
>
> More details on getting started with Spring Boot and Maven can be found in the Getting Started section of the Maven plugin's reference guide.

##### Gradle Installation

> Spring Boot is compatible with Gradle 6.8, 6.9, and 7.x. If you do not already have Gradle installed, you can follow the instructions at gradle.org.
>
> Spring Boot dependencies can be declared by using the org.springframework.boot group. Typically, your project declares dependencies to one or more ["Starters"](\l). Spring Boot provides a useful [Gradle](\l) [plugin](\l) that can be used to simplify dependency declarations and to create executable jars.
>
> More details on getting started with Spring Boot and Gradle can be found in the Getting Started section of the Gradle plugin's reference guide.

### Installing the Spring Boot CLI

> The Spring Boot CLI (Command Line Interface) is a command line tool that you can use to quickly prototype with Spring. It lets you run Groovy scripts, which means that you have a familiar Java- like syntax without so much boilerplate code.
>
> You do not need to use the CLI to work with Spring Boot, but it is a quick way to get a Spring application off the ground without an IDE.

##### Manual Installation

> You can download the Spring CLI distribution from the Spring software repository:

-   spring-boot-cli-2.5.4-bin.zip

-   spring-boot-cli-2.5.4-bin.tar.gz

> Cutting edge snapshot distributions are also available.
>
> Once downloaded, follow the INSTALL.txt instructions from the unpacked archive. In summary, there is a spring script (spring.bat for Windows) in a bin/ directory in the .zip file. Alternatively, you can use java -jar with the .jar file (the script helps you to be sure that the classpath is set correctly).

##### Installation with SDKMAN!

> SDKMAN! (The Software Development Kit Manager) can be used for managing multiple versions of various binary SDKs, including Groovy and the Spring Boot CLI. Get SDKMAN! from sdkman.io and install Spring Boot by using the following commands:
>
> If you develop features for the CLI and want access to the version you built, use the following commands:
>
> The preceding instructions install a local instance of spring called the dev instance. It points at your target build location, so every time you rebuild Spring Boot, spring is up-to-date.
>
> You can see it by running the following command:

##### OSX Homebrew Installation

> If you are on a Mac and use Homebrew, you can install the Spring Boot CLI by using the following commands:
>
> Homebrew installs spring to /usr/local/bin.
>
> **NOTE** If you do not see the formula, your installation of brew might be out-of-date. In that case, run brew update and try again.

##### MacPorts Installation

> If you are on a Mac and use MacPorts, you can install the Spring Boot CLI by using the following command:

##### Command-line Completion

> The Spring Boot CLI includes scripts that provide command completion for the BASH and zsh shells. You can source the script (also named spring) in any shell or put it in your personal or system-wide bash completion initialization. On a Debian system, the system-wide scripts are in /shell- completion/bash and all scripts in that directory are executed when a new shell starts. For example, to run the script manually if you have installed by using SDKMAN!, use the following commands:

##### NOTE

> If you install the Spring Boot CLI by using Homebrew or MacPorts, the command- line completion scripts are automatically registered with your shell.

##### Windows Scoop Installation

> If you are on a Windows and use Scoop, you can install the Spring Boot CLI by using the following commands:
>
> Scoop installs spring to \~/scoop/apps/springboot/current/bin.
>
> **NOTE** If you do not see the app manifest, your installation of scoop might be out-of-date.
>
> In that case, run scoop update and try again.

##### Quick-start Spring CLI Example

> You can use the following web application to test your installation. To start, create a file called
>
> app.groovy, as follows:
>
> Then run it from a shell, as follows:

##### NOTE

> The first run of your application is slow, as dependencies are downloaded. Subsequent runs are much quicker.
>
> Open localhost:8080 in your favorite web browser. You should see the following output:

## Developing Your First Spring Boot Application

> This section describes how to develop a small "Hello World!" web application that highlights some of Spring Boot's key features. We use Maven to build this project, since most IDEs support it.

##### TIP

> The spring.io web site contains many "Getting Started" guides that use Spring Boot. If you need to solve a specific problem, check there first.
>
> You can shortcut the steps below by going to start.spring.io and choosing the \"Web\" starter from the dependencies searcher. Doing so generates a new project structure so that you can [start coding right away](\l). Check the start.spring.io user guide for more details.
>
> Before we begin, open a terminal and run the following commands to ensure that you have valid versions of Java and Maven installed:

##### NOTE

> This sample needs to be created in its own directory. Subsequent instructions assume that you have created a suitable directory and that it is your current directory.

1.  **Creating the POM**

> We need to start by creating a Maven pom.xml file. The pom.xml is the recipe that is used to build your project. Open your favorite text editor and add the following:
>
> The preceding listing should give you a working build. You can test it by running mvn package (for now, you can ignore the "jar will be empty - no content was marked for inclusion!" warning).

##### NOTE

> At this point, you could import the project into an IDE (most modern Java IDEs include built-in support for Maven). For simplicity, we continue to use a plain text editor for this example.

### Adding Classpath Dependencies

> Spring Boot provides a number of "Starters" that let you add jars to your classpath. Our applications for smoke tests use the spring-boot-starter-parent in the parent section of the POM.
>
> The spring-boot-starter-parent is a special starter that provides useful Maven defaults. It also provides a [dependency-management](\l) section so that you can omit version tags for "blessed" dependencies.
>
> Other "Starters" provide dependencies that you are likely to need when developing a specific type of application. Since we are developing a web application, we add a spring-boot-starter-web dependency. Before that, we can look at what we currently have by running the following command:
>
> The mvn dependency:tree command prints a tree representation of your project dependencies. You can see that spring-boot-starter-parent provides no dependencies by itself. To add the necessary dependencies, edit your pom.xml and add the spring-boot-starter-web dependency immediately below the parent section:
>
> If you run mvn dependency:tree again, you see that there are now a number of additional dependencies, including the Tomcat web server and Spring Boot itself.

### Writing the Code

> To finish our application, we need to create a single Java file. By default, Maven compiles sources from src/main/java, so you need to create that directory structure and then add a file named src/main/java/MyApplication.java to contain the following code:
>
> Although there is not much code here, quite a lot is going on. We step through the important parts in the next few sections.

##### The \@RestController and \@RequestMapping Annotations

> The first annotation on our MyApplication class is \@RestController. This is known as a *stereotype* annotation. It provides hints for people reading the code and for Spring that the class plays a specific role. In this case, our class is a web \@Controller, so Spring considers it when handling incoming web requests.
>
> The \@RequestMapping annotation provides "routing" information. It tells Spring that any HTTP request with the / path should be mapped to the home method. The \@RestController annotation tells Spring to render the resulting string directly back to the caller.

##### TIP

> The \@RestController and \@RequestMapping annotations are Spring MVC annotations (they are not specific to Spring Boot). See the MVC section in the Spring Reference Documentation for more details.

##### The \@EnableAutoConfiguration Annotation

> The second class-level annotation is \@EnableAutoConfiguration. This annotation tells Spring Boot to "guess" how you want to configure Spring, based on the jar dependencies that you have added. Since spring-boot-starter-web added Tomcat and Spring MVC, the auto-configuration assumes that you are developing a web application and sets up Spring accordingly.

##### The "main" Method

> The final part of our application is the main method. This is a standard method that follows the Java convention for an application entry point. Our main method delegates to Spring Boot's SpringApplication class by calling run. SpringApplication bootstraps our application, starting Spring, which, in turn, starts the auto-configured Tomcat web server. We need to pass MyApplication.class as an argument to the run method to tell SpringApplication which is the primary Spring component. The args array is also passed through to expose any command-line arguments.

### Running the Example

> At this point, your application should work. Since you used the spring-boot-starter-parent POM, you have a useful run goal that you can use to start the application. Type mvn spring-boot:run from the root project directory to start the application. You should see output similar to the following:
>
> If you open a web browser to localhost:8080, you should see the following output:
>
> To gracefully exit the application, press ctrl-c.

### Creating an Executable Jar

> We finish our example by creating a completely self-contained executable jar file that we could run in production. Executable jars (sometimes called "fat jars") are archives containing your compiled classes along with all of the jar dependencies that your code needs to run.
>
> To create an executable jar, we need to add the spring-boot-maven-plugin to our pom.xml. To do so, insert the following lines just below the dependencies section:

##### NOTE

> The spring-boot-starter-parent POM includes \<executions> configuration to bind the repackage goal. If you do not use the parent POM, you need to declare this configuration yourself. See the plugin documentation for details.
>
> Save your pom.xml and run mvn package from the command line, as follows:
>
> If you look in the target directory, you should see myproject-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar. The file should be around 10 MB in size. If you want to peek inside, you can use jar tvf, as follows:
>
> You should also see a much smaller file named myproject-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar.original in the target
>
> directory. This is the original jar file that Maven created before it was repackaged by Spring Boot. To run that application, use the java -jar command, as follows:
>
> As before, to exit the application, press ctrl-c.

## What to Read Next

> Hopefully, this section provided some of the Spring Boot basics and got you on your way to writing
>
> your own applications. If you are a task-oriented type of developer, you might want to jump over to spring.io and check out some of the getting started guides that solve specific "How do I do that with Spring?" problems. We also have Spring Boot-specific "[How-to](\l)" reference documentation.
>
> Otherwise, the next logical step is to read [*Developing with Spring Boot*](\l). If you are really impatient, you could also jump ahead and read about [*Spring Boot features*](\l).

# Chapter 5. Upgrading Spring Boot

> Instructions for how to upgrade from earlier versions of Spring Boot are provided on the project wiki. Follow the links in the release notes section to find the version that you want to upgrade to.
>
> Upgrading instructions are always the first item in the release notes. If you are more than one release behind, please make sure that you also review the release notes of the versions that you jumped.

## Upgrading from 1.x

> If you are upgrading from the 1.x release of Spring Boot, check the "migration guide" on the project wiki that provides detailed upgrade instructions. Check also the "release notes" for a list of "new and noteworthy" features for each release.

## Upgrading to a new feature release

> When upgrading to a new feature release, some properties may have been renamed or removed. Spring Boot provides a way to analyze your application's environment and print diagnostics at startup, but also temporarily migrate properties at runtime for you. To enable that feature, add the following dependency to your project:

##### WARNING

> Properties that are added late to the environment, such as when using
>
> \@PropertySource, will not be taken into account.

##### NOTE

> Once you're done with the migration, please make sure to remove this module from your project's dependencies.

## Upgrading the Spring Boot CLI

> To upgrade an existing CLI installation, use the appropriate package manager command (for example, brew upgrade). If you manually installed the CLI, follow the [standard instructions](\l), remembering to update your PATH environment variable to remove any older references.

# Chapter 6. Developing with Spring Boot

> This section goes into more detail about how you should use Spring Boot. It covers topics such as build systems, auto-configuration, and how to run your applications. We also cover some Spring Boot best practices. Although there is nothing particularly special about Spring Boot (it is just another library that you can consume), there are a few recommendations that, when followed, make your development process a little easier.
>
> If you are starting out with Spring Boot, you should probably read the [*Getting Started*](\l) guide before diving into this section.

## Build Systems

> It is strongly recommended that you choose a build system that supports *[dependency management](\l)* and that can consume artifacts published to the "Maven Central" repository. We would recommend that you choose Maven or Gradle. It is possible to get Spring Boot to work with other build systems (Ant, for example), but they are not particularly well supported.

### Dependency Management

> Each release of Spring Boot provides a curated list of dependencies that it supports. In practice, you do not need to provide a version for any of these dependencies in your build configuration, as Spring Boot manages that for you. When you upgrade Spring Boot itself, these dependencies are upgraded as well in a consistent way.
>
> **NOTE** You can still specify a version and override Spring Boot's recommendations if you need to do so.
>
> The curated list contains all the Spring modules that you can use with Spring Boot as well as a refined list of third party libraries. The list is available as a standard Bills of Materials (spring-boot- dependencies) that can be used with both [Maven](\l) and [Gradle](\l).
>
> **WARNING** Each release of Spring Boot is associated with a base version of the Spring Framework. We **highly** recommend that you not specify its version.

### Maven

> To learn about using Spring Boot with Maven, please refer to the documentation for Spring Boot's Maven plugin:

-   Reference (HTML and PDF)

-   API

### Gradle

> To learn about using Spring Boot with Gradle, please refer to the documentation for Spring Boot's Gradle plugin:

-   Reference (HTML and PDF)

-   API

### Ant

> It is possible to build a Spring Boot project using Apache Ant+Ivy. The spring-boot-antlib "AntLib" module is also available to help Ant create executable jars.
>
> To declare dependencies, a typical ivy.xml file looks something like the following example:
>
> A typical build.xml looks like the following example:

##### TIP

> If you do not want to use the spring-boot-antlib module, see the *[Build an Executable](\l)* [*Archive from Ant without Using spring-boot-antlib*](\l) "How-to" .

### Starters

> Starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that you can include in your application. You get a one-stop shop for all the Spring and related technologies that you need without having to hunt through sample code and copy-paste loads of dependency descriptors. For example, if you want to get started using Spring and JPA for database access, include the spring-boot-starter-data- jpa dependency in your project.
>
> The starters contain a lot of the dependencies that you need to get a project up and running quickly and with a consistent, supported set of managed transitive dependencies.
>
> The following application starters are provided by Spring Boot under the org.springframework.boot

## Structuring Your Code

> Spring Boot does not require any specific code layout to work. However, there are some best practices that help.

### Using the "default" Package

> When a class does not include a package declaration, it is considered to be in the "default package". The use of the "default package" is generally discouraged and should be avoided. It can cause particular problems for Spring Boot applications that use the \@ComponentScan, \@ConfigurationPropertiesScan, \@EntityScan, or \@SpringBootApplication annotations, since every class from every jar is read.
>
> **TIP** We recommend that you follow Java's recommended package naming conventions and use a reversed domain name (for example, com.example.project).

### Locating the Main Application Class

> We generally recommend that you locate your main application class in a root package above other classes. The [\@SpringBootApplication](\l) [annotation](\l) is often placed on your main class, and it implicitly defines a base "search package" for certain items. For example, if you are writing a JPA application, the package of the \@SpringBootApplication annotated class is used to search for \@Entity items. Using a root package also allows component scan to apply only on your project.

##### TIP

> If you don't want to use \@SpringBootApplication, the \@EnableAutoConfiguration and \@ComponentScan annotations that it imports defines that behavior so you can also use those instead.
>
> The following listing shows a typical layout:
>
> The MyApplication.java file would declare the main method, along with the basic
>
> \@SpringBootApplication, as follows:

## Configuration Classes

> Spring Boot favors Java-based configuration. Although it is possible to use SpringApplication with XML sources, we generally recommend that your primary source be a single \@Configuration class. Usually the class that defines the main method is a good candidate as the primary \@Configuration.

##### TIP

> Many Spring configuration examples have been published on the Internet that use XML configuration. If possible, always try to use the equivalent Java-based configuration. Searching for Enable\* annotations can be a good starting point.

### Importing Additional Configuration Classes

> You need not put all your \@Configuration into a single class. The \@Import annotation can be used to
>
> import additional configuration classes. Alternatively, you can use \@ComponentScan to automatically pick up all Spring components, including \@Configuration classes.

### Importing XML Configuration

> If you absolutely must use XML based configuration, we recommend that you still start with a \@Configuration class. You can then use an \@ImportResource annotation to load XML configuration files.

## Auto-configuration

> Spring Boot auto-configuration attempts to automatically configure your Spring application based on the jar dependencies that you have added. For example, if HSQLDB is on your classpath, and you have not manually configured any database connection beans, then Spring Boot auto-configures an in-memory database.
>
> You need to opt-in to auto-configuration by adding the \@EnableAutoConfiguration or
>
> \@SpringBootApplication annotations to one of your \@Configuration classes.

##### TIP

> You should only ever add one \@SpringBootApplication or \@EnableAutoConfiguration annotation. We generally recommend that you add one or the other to your primary \@Configuration class only.

1.  **Gradually Replacing Auto-configuration**

> Auto-configuration is non-invasive. At any point, you can start to define your own configuration to replace specific parts of the auto-configuration. For example, if you add your own DataSource bean, the default embedded database support backs away.
>
> If you need to find out what auto-configuration is currently being applied, and why, start your application with the \--debug switch. Doing so enables debug logs for a selection of core loggers and logs a conditions report to the console.

### Disabling Specific Auto-configuration Classes

> If you find that specific auto-configuration classes that you do not want are being applied, you can use the exclude attribute of \@SpringBootApplication to disable them, as shown in the following example:
>
> If the class is not on the classpath, you can use the excludeName attribute of the annotation and specify the fully qualified name instead. If you prefer to use \@EnableAutoConfiguration rather than \@SpringBootApplication, exclude and excludeName are also available. Finally, you can also control the list of auto-configuration classes to exclude by using the spring.autoconfigure.exclude property.
>
> **TIP** You can define exclusions both at the annotation level and by using the property.

##### NOTE

> Even though auto-configuration classes are public, the only aspect of the class that is considered public API is the name of the class which can be used for disabling the auto-configuration. The actual contents of those classes, such as nested configuration classes or bean methods are for internal use only and we do not recommend using those directly.

## Spring Beans and Dependency Injection

> You are free to use any of the standard Spring Framework techniques to define your beans and their injected dependencies. We generally recommend using constructor injection to wire up dependencies and \@ComponentScan to find beans.
>
> If you structure your code as suggested above (locating your application class in a top package), you can add \@ComponentScan without any arguments or use the \@SpringBootApplication annotation which implicitly includes it. All of your application components (\@Component, \@Service, \@Repository, \@Controller etc.) are automatically registered as Spring Beans.
>
> The following example shows a \@Service Bean that uses constructor injection to obtain a required
>
> RiskAssessor bean:
>
> If a bean has more than one constructor, you'll need to mark the one you want Spring to use with
>
> \@Autowired:

##### TIP

> Notice how using constructor injection lets the riskAssessor field be marked as final, indicating that it cannot be subsequently changed.

## Using the \@SpringBootApplication Annotation

> Many Spring Boot developers like their apps to use auto-configuration, component scan and be able to define extra configuration on their \"application class\". A single \@SpringBootApplication annotation can be used to enable those three features, that is:

-   \@EnableAutoConfiguration: enable [Spring Boot's auto-configuration mechanism](\l)

-   \@ComponentScan: enable \@Component scan on the package where the application is located (see [the best practices](\l))

-   \@SpringBootConfiguration: enable registration of extra beans in the context or the import of additional configuration classes. An alternative to Spring's standard \@Configuration that aids [configuration detection](\l) in your integration tests.

##### NOTE

> \@SpringBootApplication also provides aliases to customize the attributes of
>
> \@EnableAutoConfiguration and \@ComponentScan.
>
> None of these features are mandatory and you may choose to replace this single annotation by any of the features that it enables. For instance, you may not want to use component scan or configuration properties scan in your application:

##### NOTE

> In this example, MyApplication is just like any other Spring Boot application except that \@Component-annotated classes and \@ConfigurationProperties-annotated classes are not detected automatically and the user-defined beans are imported explicitly (see \@Import).

## Running Your Application

> One of the biggest advantages of packaging your application as a jar and using an embedded HTTP server is that you can run your application as you would any other. The sample applies to debugging Spring Boot applications. You do not need any special IDE plugins or extensions.

##### NOTE

> This section only covers jar based packaging. If you choose to package your application as a war file, you should refer to your server and IDE documentation.

1.  **Running from an IDE**

> You can run a Spring Boot application from your IDE as a Java application. However, you first need to import your project. Import steps vary depending on your IDE and build system. Most IDEs can import Maven projects directly. For example, Eclipse users can select Import... → Existing Maven Projects from the File menu.
>
> If you cannot directly import your project into your IDE, you may be able to generate IDE metadata by using a build plugin. Maven includes plugins for Eclipse and IDEA. Gradle offers plugins for various IDEs.

##### TIP

> If you accidentally run a web application twice, you see a "Port already in use" error. Spring Tools users can use the Relaunch button rather than the Run button to ensure that any existing instance is closed.

### Running as a Packaged Application

> If you use the Spring Boot Maven or Gradle plugins to create an executable jar, you can run your application using java -jar, as shown in the following example:
>
> It is also possible to run a packaged application with remote debugging support enabled. Doing so lets you attach a debugger to your packaged application, as shown in the following example:

### Using the Maven Plugin

> The Spring Boot Maven plugin includes a run goal that can be used to quickly compile and run your application. Applications run in an exploded form, as they do in your IDE. The following example shows a typical Maven command to run a Spring Boot application:
>
> You might also want to use the MAVEN_OPTS operating system environment variable, as shown in the following example:

### Using the Gradle Plugin

> The Spring Boot Gradle plugin also includes a bootRun task that can be used to run your application in an exploded form. The bootRun task is added whenever you apply the org.springframework.boot and java plugins and is shown in the following example:
>
> You might also want to use the JAVA_OPTS operating system environment variable, as shown in the following example:

### Hot Swapping

> Since Spring Boot applications are plain Java applications, JVM hot-swapping should work out of the box. JVM hot swapping is somewhat limited with the bytecode that it can replace. For a more complete solution, JRebel can be used.
>
> The spring-boot-devtools module also includes support for quick application restarts. See the [Hot](\l) [swapping "How-to"](\l) for details.

## Developer Tools

> Spring Boot includes an additional set of tools that can make the application development experience a little more pleasant. The spring-boot-devtools module can be included in any project to provide additional development-time features. To include devtools support, add the module dependency to your build, as shown in the following listings for Maven and Gradle:
>
> *Maven*
>
> *Gradle*

##### NOTE

> Developer tools are automatically disabled when running a fully packaged application. If your application is launched from java -jar or if it is started from a special classloader, then it is considered a "production application". You can control this behavior by using the spring.devtools.restart.enabled system property. To enable devtools, irrespective of the classloader used to launch your application, set the -Dspring.devtools.restart.enabled=true system property. This must not be done in a production environment where running devtools is a security risk. To disable devtools, exclude the dependency or set the
>
> -Dspring.devtools.restart.enabled=false system property.

##### TIP

> Flagging the dependency as optional in Maven or using the developmentOnly configuration in Gradle (as shown above) prevents devtools from being transitively applied to other modules that use your project.

##### TIP

> Repackaged archives do not contain devtools by default. If you want to use a [certain](\l) [remote devtools feature](\l), you need to include it. When using the Maven plugin, set the excludeDevtools property to false. When using the Gradle plugin, configure the task's classpath to include the developmentOnly configuration.

1.  **Property Defaults**

> Several of the libraries supported by Spring Boot use caches to improve performance. For example, [template engines](\l) cache compiled templates to avoid repeatedly parsing template files. Also, Spring MVC can add HTTP caching headers to responses when serving static resources.
>
> While caching is very beneficial in production, it can be counter-productive during development, preventing you from seeing the changes you just made in your application. For this reason, spring- boot-devtools disables the caching options by default.
>
> Cache options are usually configured by settings in your application.properties file. For example, Thymeleaf offers the spring.thymeleaf.cache property. Rather than needing to set these properties manually, the spring-boot-devtools module automatically applies sensible development-time configuration.
>
> Because you need more information about web requests while developing Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux applications, developer tools will enable DEBUG logging for the web logging group. This will give you information about the incoming request, which handler is processing it, the response outcome, etc. If you wish to log all request details (including potentially sensitive information), you can turn on the spring.mvc.log-request-details or spring.codec.log-request-details configuration properties.
>
> **NOTE** If you don't want property defaults to be applied you can set spring.devtools.add- properties to false in your application.properties.
>
> **TIP** For a complete list of the properties that are applied by the devtools, see DevToolsPropertyDefaultsPostProcessor.

### Automatic Restart

> Applications that use spring-boot-devtools automatically restart whenever files on the classpath change. This can be a useful feature when working in an IDE, as it gives a very fast feedback loop for code changes. By default, any entry on the classpath that points to a directory is monitored for changes. Note that certain resources, such as static assets and view templates, [do not need to restart](\l) [the application](\l).

##### NOTE

> If you are restarting with Maven or Gradle using the build plugin you must leave the forking set to enabled. If you disable forking, the isolated application classloader used by devtools will not be created and restarts will not operate properly.

##### TIP

> Automatic restart works very well when used with LiveReload. [See the LiveReload](\l) [section](\l) for details. If you use JRebel, automatic restarts are disabled in favor of dynamic class reloading. Other devtools features (such as LiveReload and property overrides) can still be used.

##### NOTE

> DevTools relies on the application context's shutdown hook to close it during a restart. It does not work correctly if you have disabled the shutdown hook (SpringApplication.setRegisterShutdownHook(false)).

##### NOTE

> DevTools needs to customize the ResourceLoader used by the ApplicationContext. If your application provides one already, it is going to be wrapped. Direct override of the getResource method on the ApplicationContext is not supported.

##### Logging changes in condition evaluation

> By default, each time your application restarts, a report showing the condition evaluation delta is logged. The report shows the changes to your application's auto-configuration as you make changes such as adding or removing beans and setting configuration properties.
>
> To disable the logging of the report, set the following property:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### Excluding Resources

> Certain resources do not necessarily need to trigger a restart when they are changed. For example, Thymeleaf templates can be edited in-place. By default, changing resources in /META-INF/maven,
>
> /META-INF/resources, /resources, /static, /public, or /templates does not trigger a restart but does
>
> trigger a [live reload](\l). If you want to customize these exclusions, you can use the spring.devtools.restart.exclude property. For example, to exclude only /static and /public you would set the following property:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### TIP

> If you want to keep those defaults and *add* additional exclusions, use the
>
> spring.devtools.restart.additional-exclude property instead.

##### Watching Additional Paths

> You may want your application to be restarted or reloaded when you make changes to files that are not on the classpath. To do so, use the spring.devtools.restart.additional-paths property to configure additional paths to watch for changes. You can use the spring.devtools.restart.exclude property [described earlier](\l) to control whether changes beneath the additional paths trigger a full restart or a [live reload](\l).

##### Disabling Restart

> If you do not want to use the restart feature, you can disable it by using the spring.devtools.restart.enabled property. In most cases, you can set this property in your application.properties (doing so still initializes the restart classloader, but it does not watch for file changes).
>
> If you need to *completely* disable restart support (for example, because it does not work with a specific library), you need to set the spring.devtools.restart.enabled System property to false before calling SpringApplication.run(...), as shown in the following example:

##### Using a Trigger File

> If you work with an IDE that continuously compiles changed files, you might prefer to trigger restarts only at specific times. To do so, you can use a "trigger file", which is a special file that must be modified when you want to actually trigger a restart check.

##### NOTE

> Any update to the file will trigger a check, but restart only actually occurs if Devtools has detected it has something to do.
>
> To use a trigger file, set the spring.devtools.restart.trigger-file property to the name (excluding any path) of your trigger file. The trigger file must appear somewhere on your classpath.
>
> For example, if you have a project with the following structure:
>
> Then your trigger-file property would be:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> Restarts will now only happen when the src/main/resources/.reloadtrigger is updated.
>
> **TIP** You might want to set spring.devtools.restart.trigger-file as a [global setting](\l), so that all your projects behave in the same way.
>
> Some IDEs have features that save you from needing to update your trigger file manually. Spring Tools for Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA (Ultimate Edition) both have such support. With Spring Tools, you can use the "reload" button from the console view (as long as your trigger-file is named
>
> .reloadtrigger). For IntelliJ IDEA, you can follow the instructions in their documentation.

##### Customizing the Restart Classloader

> As described earlier in the [Restart vs Reload](\l) section, restart functionality is implemented by using two classloaders. For most applications, this approach works well. However, it can sometimes cause classloading issues.
>
> By default, any open project in your IDE is loaded with the "restart" classloader, and any regular
>
> .jar file is loaded with the "base" classloader. If you work on a multi-module project, and not every module is imported into your IDE, you may need to customize things. To do so, you can create a META-INF/spring-devtools.properties file.
>
> The spring-devtools.properties file can contain properties prefixed with restart.exclude and
>
> restart.include. The include elements are items that should be pulled up into the "restart" classloader, and the exclude elements are items that should be pushed down into the "base" classloader. The value of the property is a regex pattern that is applied to the classpath, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### NOTE

> All property keys must be unique. As long as a property starts with restart.include.
>
> or restart.exclude. it is considered.

##### TIP

> All META-INF/spring-devtools.properties from the classpath are loaded. You can package files inside your project, or in the libraries that the project consumes.

##### Known Limitations

> Restart functionality does not work well with objects that are deserialized by using a standard ObjectInputStream. If you need to deserialize data, you may need to use Spring's ConfigurableObjectInputStream in combination with Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().
>
> Unfortunately, several third-party libraries deserialize without considering the context classloader. If you find such a problem, you need to request a fix with the original authors.

### LiveReload

> The spring-boot-devtools module includes an embedded LiveReload server that can be used to trigger a browser refresh when a resource is changed. LiveReload browser extensions are freely available for Chrome, Firefox and Safari from livereload.com.
>
> If you do not want to start the LiveReload server when your application runs, you can set the
>
> spring.devtools.livereload.enabled property to false.

##### NOTE

> You can only run one LiveReload server at a time. Before starting your application, ensure that no other LiveReload servers are running. If you start multiple applications from your IDE, only the first has LiveReload support.
>
> **WARNING** To trigger LiveReload when a file changes, [Automatic Restart](\l) must be enabled.

### Global Settings

> You can configure global devtools settings by adding any of the following files to the
>
> \$HOME/.config/spring-boot directory:

1.  spring-boot-devtools.properties

2.  spring-boot-devtools.yaml

3.  spring-boot-devtools.yml

> Any properties added to these file apply to *all* Spring Boot applications on your machine that use devtools. For example, to configure restart to always use a [trigger file](\l), you would add the following property to your spring-boot-devtools file:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### NOTE

> If devtools configuration files are not found in \$HOME/.config/spring-boot, the root of the \$HOME directory is searched for the presence of a .spring-boot- devtools.properties file. This allows you to share the devtools global configuration with applications that are on an older version of Spring Boot that does not support the \$HOME/.config/spring-boot location.

##### NOTE

> Profiles are not supported in devtools properties/yaml files.
>
> Any profiles activated in .spring-boot-devtools.properties will not affect the loading of [profile-specific configuration files](\l). Profile specific filenames (of the form spring-boot-devtools-\<profile>.properties) and spring.config.activate.on-profile documents in both YAML and Properties files are not supported.

##### Configuring File System Watcher

> FileSystemWatcher works by polling the class changes with a certain time interval, and then waiting for a predefined quiet period to make sure there are no more changes. Since Spring Boot relies entirely on the IDE to compile and copy files into the location from where Spring Boot can read them, you might find that there are times when certain changes are not reflected when devtools restarts the application. If you observe such problems constantly, try increasing the spring.devtools.restart.poll-interval and spring.devtools.restart.quiet-period parameters to
>
> the values that fit your development environment:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> The monitored classpath directories are now polled every 2 seconds for changes, and a 1 second quiet period is maintained to make sure there are no additional class changes.

### Remote Applications

> The Spring Boot developer tools are not limited to local development. You can also use several features when running applications remotely. Remote support is opt-in as enabling it can be a security risk. It should only be enabled when running on a trusted network or when secured with SSL. If neither of these options is available to you, you should not use DevTools\' remote support. You should never enable support on a production deployment.
>
> To enable it, you need to make sure that devtools is included in the repackaged archive, as shown in the following listing:
>
> Then you need to set the spring.devtools.remote.secret property. Like any important password or secret, the value should be unique and strong such that it cannot be guessed or brute-forced.
>
> Remote devtools support is provided in two parts: a server-side endpoint that accepts connections and a client application that you run in your IDE. The server component is automatically enabled when the spring.devtools.remote.secret property is set. The client component must be launched manually.

##### Running the Remote Client Application

> The remote client application is designed to be run from within your IDE. You need to run org.springframework.boot.devtools.RemoteSpringApplication with the same classpath as the remote project that you connect to. The application's single required argument is the remote URL to which it connects.
>
> For example, if you are using Eclipse or Spring Tools and you have a project named my-app that you have deployed to Cloud Foundry, you would do the following:

-   Select Run Configurations... from the Run menu.

-   Create a new Java Application "launch configuration".

-   Browse for the my-app project.

-   Use org.springframework.boot.devtools.RemoteSpringApplication as the main class.

-   Add https://myapp.cfapps.io to the Program arguments (or whatever your remote URL is).

> A running remote client might resemble the following listing:
>

##### NOTE

> Because the remote client is using the same classpath as the real application it can directly read application properties. This is how the spring.devtools.remote.secret property is read and passed to the server for authentication.

##### TIP

> **TIP**
>
> It is always advisable to use https:// as the connection protocol, so that traffic is encrypted and passwords cannot be intercepted.
>
> If you need to use a proxy to access the remote application, configure the
>
> spring.devtools.remote.proxy.host and spring.devtools.remote.proxy.port properties.

##### Remote Update

> The remote client monitors your application classpath for changes in the same way as the [local](\l) [restart](\l). Any updated resource is pushed to the remote application and (*if required*) triggers a restart. This can be helpful if you iterate on a feature that uses a cloud service that you do not have locally. Generally, remote updates and restarts are much quicker than a full rebuild and deploy cycle.
>
> On a slower development environment, it may happen that the quiet period is not enough, and the changes in the classes may be split into batches. The server is restarted after the first batch of class changes is uploaded. The next batch can't be sent to the application, since the server is restarting.
>
> This is typically manifested by a warning in the RemoteSpringApplication logs about failing to upload some of the classes, and a consequent retry. But it may also lead to application code inconsistency and failure to restart after the first batch of changes is uploaded. If you observe such problems constantly, try increasing the spring.devtools.restart.poll-interval and spring.devtools.restart.quiet-period parameters to the values that fit your development environment. See the [Configuring File System Watcher](\l) section for configuring these properties.
>
> **NOTE** Files are only monitored when the remote client is running. If you change a file before starting the remote client, it is not pushed to the remote server.

## Packaging Your Application for Production

> Executable jars can be used for production deployment. As they are self-contained, they are also ideally suited for cloud-based deployment.
>
> For additional "production ready" features, such as health, auditing, and metric REST or JMX end- points, consider adding spring-boot-actuator. See *[Spring Boot Actuator: Production-ready Features](\l)* for details.

## What to Read Next

> You should now understand how you can use Spring Boot and some best practices that you should follow. You can now go on to learn about specific [*Spring Boot features*](\l) in depth, or you could skip ahead and read about the "[production ready](\l)" aspects of Spring Boot.

# Chapter 7. Spring Boot Features

> This section dives into the details of Spring Boot. Here you can learn about the key features that you may want to use and customize. If you have not already done so, you might want to read the \"[Getting Started](\l)\" and \"[Developing with Spring Boot](\l)\" sections, so that you have a good grounding of the basics.

## SpringApplication

> The SpringApplication class provides a convenient way to bootstrap a Spring application that is started from a main() method. In many situations, you can delegate to the static SpringApplication.run method, as shown in the following example:
>
> When your application starts, you should see something similar to the following output:

Startup information logging can be turned off by setting spring.main.log-startup-info to false. This will also turn off logging of the application's active profiles.

1.  **Startup Failure**

> If your application fails to start, registered FailureAnalyzers get a chance to provide a dedicated error message and a concrete action to fix the problem. For instance, if you start a web application on port 8080 and that port is already in use, you should see something similar to the following message:

##### NOTE

> Spring Boot provides numerous FailureAnalyzer implementations, and you can [add](\l) [your own](\l).
>
> If no failure analyzers are able to handle the exception, you can still display the full conditions report to better understand what went wrong. To do so, you need to [enable the](\l) [debug](\l) [property](\l) or [enable](\l) [DEBUG](\l) [logging](\l) for org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.logging.ConditionEvaluationReportLoggingListener.
>
> For instance, if you are running your application by using java -jar, you can enable the debug
>
> property as follows:

### Lazy Initialization

> SpringApplication allows an application to be initialized lazily. When lazy initialization is enabled, beans are created as they are needed rather than during application startup. As a result, enabling lazy initialization can reduce the time that it takes your application to start. In a web application, enabling lazy initialization will result in many web-related beans not being initialized until an HTTP request is received.
>
> A downside of lazy initialization is that it can delay the discovery of a problem with the application. If a misconfigured bean is initialized lazily, a failure will no longer occur during startup and the problem will only become apparent when the bean is initialized. Care must also be taken to ensure that the JVM has sufficient memory to accommodate all of the application's beans and not just those that are initialized during startup. For these reasons, lazy initialization is not enabled by default and it is recommended that fine-tuning of the JVM's heap size is done before enabling lazy
>
> initialization.
>
> Lazy initialization can be enabled programmatically using the lazyInitialization method on SpringApplicationBuilder or the setLazyInitialization method on SpringApplication. Alternatively, it can be enabled using the spring.main.lazy-initialization property as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### TIP

> If you want to disable lazy initialization for certain beans while using lazy initialization for the rest of the application, you can explicitly set their lazy attribute to false using the \@Lazy(false) annotation.

### Customizing the Banner

> The banner that is printed on start up can be changed by adding a banner.txt file to your classpath or by setting the spring.banner.location property to the location of such a file. If the file has an encoding other than UTF-8, you can set spring.banner.charset. In addition to a text file, you can also add a banner.gif, banner.jpg, or banner.png image file to your classpath or set the spring.banner.image.location property. Images are converted into an ASCII art representation and printed above any text banner.
>
> Inside your banner.txt file, you can use any of the following placeholders:
>
> *Table 4. Banner variables*

----------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Variable**                        **Description**

  \${application.version}             The version number of your application, as declared in MANIFEST.MF. For example, Implementation-Version: 1.0 is printed as 1.0.

  \${application.formatted-version}   The version number of your application, as declared in MANIFEST.MF and formatted for display (surrounded with brackets and prefixed with v). For example (v1.0).

  \${spring-boot.version}             The Spring Boot version that you are using. For example 2.5.4.

  \${spring-boot.formatted-version}   The Spring Boot version that you are using, formatted for display (surrounded with brackets and prefixed with v). For example (v2.5.4).
----------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+----------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Variable**                                 | **Description**                                                                                                         |

| \${AnsiBackground.NAME}, \${AnsiStyle.NAME}) |                                                                                                                         |
+----------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| \${application.title}                        | The title of your application, as declared in MANIFEST.MF. For example Implementation-Title: MyApp is printed as MyApp. |
+----------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

##### TIP

> The SpringApplication.setBanner(...) method can be used if you want to generate a banner programmatically. Use the org.springframework.boot.Banner interface and implement your own printBanner() method.
>
> You can also use the spring.main.banner-mode property to determine if the banner has to be printed on System.out (console), sent to the configured logger (log), or not produced at all (off).
>
> The printed banner is registered as a singleton bean under the following name: springBootBanner.

##### NOTE

> The \${application.version} and \${application.formatted-version} properties are only available if you are using Spring Boot launchers. The values won't be resolved if you are running an unpacked jar and starting it with java -cp \<classpath>
>
> \<mainclass>.
>
> This is why we recommend that you always launch unpacked jars using java org.springframework.boot.loader.JarLauncher. This will initialize the application.\* banner variables before building the classpath and launching your app.

### Customizing SpringApplication

> If the SpringApplication defaults are not to your taste, you can instead create a local instance and customize it. For example, to turn off the banner, you could write:

##### NOTE

> The constructor arguments passed to SpringApplication are configuration sources for Spring beans. In most cases, these are references to \@Configuration classes, but they could also be direct references \@Component classes.
>
> It is also possible to configure the SpringApplication by using an application.properties file. See
>
> [*Externalized Configuration*](\l) for details.
>
> For a complete list of the configuration options, see the SpringApplication Javadoc.

### Fluent Builder API

> If you need to build an ApplicationContext hierarchy (multiple contexts with a parent/child relationship) or if you prefer using a "fluent" builder API, you can use the SpringApplicationBuilder.
>
> The SpringApplicationBuilder lets you chain together multiple method calls and includes parent and
>
> child methods that let you create a hierarchy, as shown in the following example:

##### NOTE

> There are some restrictions when creating an ApplicationContext hierarchy. For example, Web components **must** be contained within the child context, and the same Environment is used for both parent and child contexts. See the SpringApplicationBuilder Javadoc for full details.

### Application Availability

> When deployed on platforms, applications can provide information about their availability to the platform using infrastructure such as Kubernetes Probes. Spring Boot includes out-of-the box support for the commonly used "liveness" and "readiness" availability states. If you are using Spring Boot's "actuator" support then these states are exposed as health endpoint groups.
>
> In addition, you can also obtain availability states by injecting the ApplicationAvailability interface into your own beans.

##### Liveness State

> The "Liveness" state of an application tells whether its internal state allows it to work correctly, or recover by itself if it's currently failing. A broken "Liveness" state means that the application is in a state that it cannot recover from, and the infrastructure should restart the application.

##### NOTE

> In general, the \"Liveness\" state should not be based on external checks, such as [Health checks](\l). If it did, a failing external system (a database, a Web API, an external cache) would trigger massive restarts and cascading failures across the platform.
>
> The internal state of Spring Boot applications is mostly represented by the Spring ApplicationContext. If the application context has started successfully, Spring Boot assumes that the application is in a valid state. An application is considered live as soon as the context has been refreshed, see [Spring Boot application lifecycle and related Application Events](\l).

##### Readiness State

> The "Readiness" state of an application tells whether the application is ready to handle traffic. A failing "Readiness" state tells the platform that it should not route traffic to the application for now. This typically happens during startup, while CommandLineRunner and ApplicationRunner components are being processed, or at any time if the application decides that it's too busy for additional traffic.
>
> An application is considered ready as soon as application and command-line runners have been called, see [Spring Boot application lifecycle and related Application Events](\l).

##### TIP

> Tasks expected to run during startup should be executed by CommandLineRunner and ApplicationRunner components instead of using Spring component lifecycle callbacks such as \@PostConstruct.

##### Managing the Application Availability State

> Application components can retrieve the current availability state at any time, by injecting the ApplicationAvailability interface and calling methods on it. More often, applications will want to listen to state updates or update the state of the application.
>
> For example, we can export the \"Readiness\" state of the application to a file so that a Kubernetes \"exec Probe\" can look at this file:
>
> We can also update the state of the application, when the application breaks and cannot recover:
>
> Spring Boot provides [Kubernetes HTTP probes for \"Liveness\" and \"Readiness\" with Actuator Health](\l) [Endpoints](\l). You can get more guidance about [deploying Spring Boot applications on Kubernetes in](\l) [the dedicated section](\l).

### Application Events and Listeners

> In addition to the usual Spring Framework events, such as ContextRefreshedEvent, a
>
> SpringApplication sends some additional application events.

##### NOTE

> Some events are actually triggered before the ApplicationContext is created, so you cannot register a listener on those as a \@Bean. You can register them with the SpringApplication.addListeners(...) method or the SpringApplicationBuilder.listeners(...) method.
>
> If you want those listeners to be registered automatically, regardless of the way the application is created, you can add a META-INF/spring.factories file to your project and reference your listener(s) by using the org.springframework.context.ApplicationListener key, as shown in the following example:
>
> Application events are sent in the following order, as your application runs:

1.  An ApplicationStartingEvent is sent at the start of a run but before any processing, except for the registration of listeners and initializers.

2.  An ApplicationEnvironmentPreparedEvent is sent when the Environment to be used in the context is known but before the context is created.

3.  An ApplicationContextInitializedEvent is sent when the ApplicationContext is prepared and ApplicationContextInitializers have been called but before any bean definitions are loaded.

4.  An ApplicationPreparedEvent is sent just before the refresh is started but after bean definitions have been loaded.

5.  An ApplicationStartedEvent is sent after the context has been refreshed but before any application and command-line runners have been called.

6.  An AvailabilityChangeEvent is sent right after with LivenessState.CORRECT to indicate that the application is considered as live.

7.  An ApplicationReadyEvent is sent after any [application and command-line runners](\l) have been called.

8.  An AvailabilityChangeEvent is sent right after with ReadinessState.ACCEPTING_TRAFFIC to indicate that the application is ready to service requests.

9.  An ApplicationFailedEvent is sent if there is an exception on startup.

> The above list only includes SpringApplicationEvents that are tied to a SpringApplication. In addition to these, the following events are also published after ApplicationPreparedEvent and before ApplicationStartedEvent:

-   A WebServerInitializedEvent is sent after the WebServer is ready. ServletWebServerInitializedEvent and ReactiveWebServerInitializedEvent are the servlet and reactive variants respectively.

-   A ContextRefreshedEvent is sent when an ApplicationContext is refreshed.

##### TIP

> You often need not use application events, but it can be handy to know that they exist. Internally, Spring Boot uses events to handle a variety of tasks.

##### NOTE

> Event listeners should not run potentially lengthy tasks as they execute in the same thread by default. Consider using [application and command-line runners](\l) instead.
>
> Application events are sent by using Spring Framework's event publishing mechanism. Part of this mechanism ensures that an event published to the listeners in a child context is also published to the listeners in any ancestor contexts. As a result of this, if your application uses a hierarchy of SpringApplication instances, a listener may receive multiple instances of the same type of application event.
>
> To allow your listener to distinguish between an event for its context and an event for a descendant context, it should request that its application context is injected and then compare the injected context with the context of the event. The context can be injected by implementing ApplicationContextAware or, if the listener is a bean, by using \@Autowired.

### Web Environment

> A SpringApplication attempts to create the right type of ApplicationContext on your behalf. The algorithm used to determine a WebApplicationType is the following:

-   If Spring MVC is present, an AnnotationConfigServletWebServerApplicationContext is used

-   If Spring MVC is not present and Spring WebFlux is present, an

> AnnotationConfigReactiveWebServerApplicationContext is used

-   Otherwise, AnnotationConfigApplicationContext is used

> This means that if you are using Spring MVC and the new WebClient from Spring WebFlux in the same application, Spring MVC will be used by default. You can override that easily by calling setWebApplicationType(WebApplicationType).
>
> It is also possible to take complete control of the ApplicationContext type that is used by calling
>
> setApplicationContextClass(...).
>
> **TIP** It is often desirable to call setWebApplicationType(WebApplicationType.NONE) when using SpringApplication within a JUnit test.

### Accessing Application Arguments

> If you need to access the application arguments that were passed to SpringApplication.run(...), you can inject a org.springframework.boot.ApplicationArguments bean. The ApplicationArguments interface provides access to both the raw String\[\] arguments as well as parsed option and non- option arguments, as shown in the following example:

##### TIP

> Spring Boot also registers a CommandLinePropertySource with the Spring Environment. This lets you also inject single application arguments by using the \@Value annotation.

### Using the ApplicationRunner or CommandLineRunner

> If you need to run some specific code once the SpringApplication has started, you can implement the ApplicationRunner or CommandLineRunner interfaces. Both interfaces work in the same way and offer a single run method, which is called just before SpringApplication.run(...) completes.
>
> **NOTE** This contract is well suited for tasks that should run after application startup but before it starts accepting traffic.
>
> The CommandLineRunner interfaces provides access to application arguments as a string array, whereas the ApplicationRunner uses the ApplicationArguments interface discussed earlier. The following example shows a CommandLineRunner with a run method:
>
> If several CommandLineRunner or ApplicationRunner beans are defined that must be called in a specific order, you can additionally implement the org.springframework.core.Ordered interface or use the org.springframework.core.annotation.Order annotation.

### Application Exit

> Each SpringApplication registers a shutdown hook with the JVM to ensure that the ApplicationContext closes gracefully on exit. All the standard Spring lifecycle callbacks (such as the DisposableBean interface or the \@PreDestroy annotation) can be used.
>
> In addition, beans may implement the org.springframework.boot.ExitCodeGenerator interface if they wish to return a specific exit code when SpringApplication.exit() is called. This exit code can then be passed to System.exit() to return it as a status code, as shown in the following example:
>
> Also, the ExitCodeGenerator interface may be implemented by exceptions. When such an exception is encountered, Spring Boot returns the exit code provided by the implemented getExitCode() method.

### Admin Features

> It is possible to enable admin-related features for the application by specifying the spring.application.admin.enabled property. This exposes the SpringApplicationAdminMXBean on the platform MBeanServer. You could use this feature to administer your Spring Boot application remotely. This feature could also be useful for any service wrapper implementation.
>
> **TIP** If you want to know on which HTTP port the application is running, get the property with a key of local.server.port.

### Application Startup tracking

> During the application startup, the SpringApplication and the ApplicationContext perform many tasks related to the application lifecycle, the beans lifecycle or even processing application events. With ApplicationStartup, Spring Framework allows you to track the application startup sequence with StartupStep objects. This data can be collected for profiling purposes, or just to have a better understanding of an application startup process.
>
> You can choose an ApplicationStartup implementation when setting up the SpringApplication
>
> instance. For example, to use the BufferingApplicationStartup, you could write:
>
> The first available implementation, FlightRecorderApplicationStartup is provided by Spring Framework. It adds Spring-specific startup events to a Java Flight Recorder session and is meant for profiling applications and correlating their Spring context lifecycle with JVM events (such as allocations, GCs, class loading...). Once configured, you can record data by running the application with the Flight Recorder enabled:
>
> Spring Boot ships with the BufferingApplicationStartup variant; this implementation is meant for buffering the startup steps and draining them into an external metrics system. Applications can ask for the bean of type BufferingApplicationStartup in any component.
>
> Spring Boot can also be configured to expose a startup endpoint that provides this information as a JSON document.

## Externalized Configuration

> Spring Boot lets you externalize your configuration so that you can work with the same application code in different environments. You can use a variety of external configuration sources, include Java properties files, YAML files, environment variables, and command-line arguments.
>
> Property values can be injected directly into your beans by using the \@Value annotation, accessed through Spring's Environment abstraction, or be [bound to structured objects](\l) through \@ConfigurationProperties.
>
> Spring Boot uses a very particular PropertySource order that is designed to allow sensible overriding of values. Properties are considered in the following order (with values from lower items overriding earlier ones):

1.  Default properties (specified by setting SpringApplication.setDefaultProperties).

2.  \@PropertySource annotations on your \@Configuration classes. Please note that such property sources are not added to the Environment until the application context is being refreshed. This is too late to configure certain properties such as logging.\* and spring.main.\* which are read before refresh begins.

3.  Config data (such as application.properties files)

4.  A RandomValuePropertySource that has properties only in random.\*.

5.  OS environment variables.

6.  Java System properties (System.getProperties()).

7.  JNDI attributes from java:comp/env.

8.  ServletContext init parameters.

9.  ServletConfig init parameters.

10. Properties from SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON (inline JSON embedded in an environment variable or system property).

11. Command line arguments.

12. properties attribute on your tests. Available on \@SpringBootTest and the [test annotations for testing a particular slice of your application](\l).

13. \@TestPropertySource annotations on your tests.

14. [Devtools global settings properties](\l) in the \$HOME/.config/spring-boot directory when devtools is active.

> Config data files are considered in the following order:

1.  [Application properties](\l) packaged inside your jar (application.properties and YAML variants).

2.  [Profile-specific application properties](\l) packaged inside your jar (application-

> {profile}.properties and YAML variants).

3.  [Application properties](\l) outside of your packaged jar (application.properties and YAML variants).

4.  [Profile-specific application properties](\l) outside of your packaged jar (application-

> {profile}.properties and YAML variants).

##### NOTE

> It is recommended to stick with one format for your entire application. If you have configuration files with both .properties and .yml format in the same location,
>
> .properties takes precedence.
>
> To provide a concrete example, suppose you develop a \@Component that uses a name property, as shown in the following example:
>
> On your application classpath (for example, inside your jar) you can have an application.properties file that provides a sensible default property value for name. When running in a new environment, an application.properties file can be provided outside of your jar that overrides the name. For one-off testing, you can launch with a specific command line switch (for example, java -jar app.jar \--name=\"Spring\").

##### TIP

> The env and configprops endpoints can be useful in determining why a property has a particular value. You can use these two endpoints to diagnose unexpected property values. See the \"[Production ready features](\l)\" section for details.

1.  **Accessing Command Line Properties**

> By default, SpringApplication converts any command line option arguments (that is, arguments starting with \--, such as \--server.port=9000) to a property and adds them to the Spring Environment. As mentioned previously, command line properties always take precedence over file based property sources.
>
> If you do not want command line properties to be added to the Environment, you can disable them by using SpringApplication.setAddCommandLineProperties(false).

### JSON Application Properties

> Environment variables and system properties often have restrictions that mean some property names cannot be used. To help with this, Spring Boot allows you to encode a block of properties into a single JSON structure.
>
> When your application starts, any spring.application.json or SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON properties will be parsed and added to the Environment.
>
> For example, the SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON property can be supplied on the command line in a UN\*X shell as an environment variable:
>
> In the preceding example, you end up with my.name=test in the Spring Environment. The same JSON can also be provided as a system property:
>
> Or you could supply the JSON by using a command line argument:
>
> If you are deploying to a classic Application Server, you could also use a JNDI variable named
>
> java:comp/env/spring.application.json.

##### NOTE

> Although null values from the JSON will be added to the resulting property source, the PropertySourcesPropertyResolver treats null properties as missing values. This means that the JSON cannot override properties from lower order property sources with a null value.

### External Application Properties

> Spring Boot will automatically find and load application.properties and application.yaml files from the following locations when your application starts:

1.  From the classpath

    a.  The classpath root

    b.  The classpath /config package

2.  From the current directory

    a.  The current directory

    b.  The /config subdirectory in the current directory

    c.  Immediate child directories of the /config subdirectory

> The list is ordered by precedence (with values from lower items overriding earlier ones). Documents from the loaded files are added as PropertySources to the Spring Environment.
>
> If you do not like application as the configuration file name, you can switch to another file name by specifying a spring.config.name environment property. For example, to look for myproject.properties and myproject.yaml files you can run your application as follows:
>
> You can also refer to an explicit location by using the spring.config.location environment property. This properties accepts a comma-separated list of one or more locations to check.
>
> The following example shows how to specify two distinct files:

##### TIP

> Use the prefix optional: if the [locations are optional](\l) and you don't mind if they don't exist.

##### WARNING

> spring.config.name, spring.config.location, and spring.config.additional- location are used very early to determine which files have to be loaded. They must be defined as an environment property (typically an OS environment variable, a system property, or a command-line argument).
>
> If spring.config.location contains directories (as opposed to files), they should end in /. At runtime they will be appended with the names generated from spring.config.name before being loaded. Files specified in spring.config.location are imported directly.

##### NOTE

> Both directory and file location values are also expanded to check for [profile-](\l) [specific files](\l). For example, if you have a spring.config.location of classpath:myconfig.properties, you will also find appropriate classpath:myconfig-
>
> \<profile>.properties files are loaded.
>
> In most situations, each spring.config.location item you add will reference a single file or directory. Locations are processed in the order that they are defined and later ones can override the values of earlier ones.
>
> If you have a complex location setup, and you use profile-specific configuration files, you may need to provide further hints so that Spring Boot knows how they should be grouped. A location group is a collection of locations that are all considered at the same level. For example, you might want to group all classpath locations, then all external locations. Items within a location group should be separated with ;. See the example in the "[Profile Specific Files](\l)" section for more details.
>
> Locations configured by using spring.config.location replace the default locations. For example, if spring.config.location is configured with the value optional:classpath:/custom- config/,optional:file:./custom-config/, the complete set of locations considered is:

1.  optional:classpath:custom-config/

2.  optional:file:./custom-config/

> If you prefer to add additional locations, rather than replacing them, you can use spring.config.additional-location. Properties loaded from additional locations can override those in the default locations. For example, if spring.config.additional-location is configured with the value optional:classpath:/custom-config/,optional:file:./custom-config/, the complete set of
>
> locations considered is:

1.  optional:classpath:/;optional:classpath:/config/

2.  optional:file:./;optional:file:./config/;optional:file:./config/\*/

3.  optional:classpath:custom-config/

4.  optional:file:./custom-config/

> This search ordering lets you specify default values in one configuration file and then selectively override those values in another. You can provide default values for your application in application.properties (or whatever other basename you choose with spring.config.name) in one of the default locations. These default values can then be overridden at runtime with a different file located in one of the custom locations.

##### NOTE

> If you use environment variables rather than system properties, most operating systems disallow period-separated key names, but you can use underscores instead (for example, SPRING_CONFIG_NAME instead of spring.config.name). See [Binding from](\l) [Environment Variables](\l) for details.

##### NOTE

> If your application runs in a servlet container or application server, then JNDI properties (in java:comp/env) or servlet context initialization parameters can be used instead of, or as well as, environment variables or system properties.

##### Optional Locations

> By default, when a specified config data location does not exist, Spring Boot will throw a
>
> ConfigDataLocationNotFoundException and your application will not start.
>
> If you want to specify a location, but you don't mind if it doesn't always exist, you can use the optional: prefix. You can use this prefix with the spring.config.location and spring.config.additional-location properties, as well as with [spring.config.import](\l) declarations.
>
> For example, a spring.config.import value of optional:file:./myconfig.properties allows your application to start, even if the myconfig.properties file is missing.
>
> If you want to ignore all ConfigDataLocationNotFoundExceptions and always continue to start your application, you can use the spring.config.on-not-found property. Set the value to ignore using SpringApplication.setDefaultProperties(...) or with a system/environment variable.

##### Wildcard Locations

> If a config file location includes the \* character for the last path segment, it is considered a wildcard location. Wildcards are expanded when the config is loaded so that immediate subdirectories are also checked. Wildcard locations are particularly useful in an environment such as Kubernetes when there are multiple sources of config properties.
>
> For example, if you have some Redis configuration and some MySQL configuration, you might want to keep those two pieces of configuration separate, while requiring that both those are present in an application.properties file. This might result in two separate application.properties files
>
> mounted at different locations such as /config/redis/application.properties and
>
> /config/mysql/application.properties. In such a case, having a wildcard location of config/\*/, will result in both files being processed.
>
> By default, Spring Boot includes config/\*/ in the default search locations. It means that all subdirectories of the /config directory outside of your jar will be searched.
>
> You can use wildcard locations yourself with the spring.config.location and
>
> spring.config.additional-location properties.

##### NOTE

> A wildcard location must contain only one \* and end with \*/ for search locations that are directories or \*/\<filename> for search locations that are files. Locations with wildcards are sorted alphabetically based on the absolute path of the file names.

##### TIP

> Wildcard locations only work with external directories. You cannot use a wildcard in a
>
> classpath: location.

##### Profile Specific Files

> As well as application property files, Spring Boot will also attempt to load profile-specific files using the naming convention application-{profile}. For example, if your application activates a profile named prod and uses YAML files, then both application.yml and application-prod.yml will be considered.
>
> Profile-specific properties are loaded from the same locations as standard application.properties, with profile-specific files always overriding the non-specific ones. If several profiles are specified, a last-wins strategy applies. For example, if profiles prod,live are specified by the spring.profiles.active property, values in application-prod.properties can be overridden by those in application-live.properties.
>
> The last-wins strategy applies at the [location group](\l) level. A spring.config.location of classpath:/cfg/,classpath:/ext/ will not have the same override rules as classpath:/cfg/;classpath:/ext/.
>
> For example, continuing our prod,live example above, we might have the following files:

##### NOTE

> When we have a spring.config.location of classpath:/cfg/,classpath:/ext/ we process all /cfg files before all /ext files:

1.  /cfg/application-live.properties

2.  /ext/application-prod.properties

3.  /ext/application-live.properties

> When we have classpath:/cfg/;classpath:/ext/ instead (with a ; delimiter) we process /cfg and /ext at the same level:

1.  /ext/application-prod.properties

2.  /cfg/application-live.properties

3.  /ext/application-live.properties

> The Environment has a set of default profiles (by default, \[default\]) that are used if no active profiles are set. In other words, if no profiles are explicitly activated, then properties from application- default are considered.
>
> **NOTE** Properties files are only ever loaded once. If you've already directly [imported](\l) a profile specific property files then it won't be imported a second time.

##### Importing Additional Data

> Application properties may import further config data from other locations using the spring.config.import property. Imports are processed as they are discovered, and are treated as additional documents inserted immediately below the one that declares the import.
>
> For example, you might have the following in your classpath application.properties file:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> This will trigger the import of a dev.properties file in current directory (if such a file exists). Values from the imported dev.properties will take precedence over the file that triggered the import. In the above example, the dev.properties could redefine spring.application.name to a different value.
>
> An import will only be imported once no matter how many times it is declared. The order an import is defined inside a single document within the properties/yaml file doesn't matter. For instance, the two examples below produce the same result:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> In both of the above examples, the values from the my.properties file will take precedence over the file that triggered its import.
>
> Several locations can be specified under a single spring.config.import key. Locations will be processed in the order that they are defined, with later imports taking precedence.

##### NOTE

> When appropriate, [Profile-specific variants](\l) are also considered for import. The example above would import both my.properties as well as any my-
>
> \<profile>.properties variants.

##### TIP

> Spring Boot includes pluggable API that allows various different location addresses to be supported. By default you can import Java Properties, YAML and "[configuration](\l) [trees](\l)".
>
> Third-party jars can offer support for additional technologies (there's no requirement for files to be local). For example, you can imagine config data being from external stores such as Consul, Apache ZooKeeper or Netflix Archaius.
>
> If you want to support your own locations, see the ConfigDataLocationResolver and
>
> ConfigDataLoader classes in the org.springframework.boot.context.config package.

##### Importing Extensionless Files

> Some cloud platforms cannot add a file extension to volume mounted files. To import these extensionless files, you need to give Spring Boot a hint so that it knows how to load them. You can do this by putting an extension hint in square brackets.
>
> For example, suppose you have a /etc/config/myconfig file that you wish to import as yaml. You can import it from your application.properties using the following:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### Using Configuration Trees

> When running applications on a cloud platform (such as Kubernetes) you often need to read config values that the platform supplies. It's not uncommon to use environment variables for such purposes, but this can have drawbacks, especially if the value is supposed to be kept secret.
>
> As an alternative to environment variables, many cloud platforms now allow you to map configuration into mounted data volumes. For example, Kubernetes can volume mount both ConfigMaps and Secrets.
>
> There are two common volume mount patterns that can be use:

1.  A single file contains a complete set of properties (usually written as YAML).

2.  Multiple files are written to a directory tree, with the filename becoming the 'key' and the

> contents becoming the 'value'.
>
> For the first case, you can import the YAML or Properties file directly using spring.config.import as described [above](\l). For the second case, you need to use the configtree: prefix so that Spring Boot knows it needs to expose all the files as properties.
>
> As an example, let's imagine that Kubernetes has mounted the following volume:
>
> The contents of the username file would be a config value, and the contents of password would be a secret.
>
> To import these properties, you can add the following to your application.properties or
>
> application.yaml file:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> You can then access or inject myapp.username and myapp.password properties from the Environment in the usual way.
>
> **TIP** Configuration tree values can be bound to both string String and byte\[\] types depending on the contents expected.
>
> If you have multiple config trees to import from the same parent folder you can use a wildcard shortcut. Any configtree: location that ends with /\*/ will import all immediate children as config trees.
>
> For example, given the following volume:
>
> You can use configtree:/etc/config/\*/ as the import location:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> This will add db.username, db.password, mq.username and mq.password properties.
>
> **NOTE** Directories loaded using a wildcard are sorted alphabetically. If you need a different order, then you should list each location as a separate import
>
> Configuration trees can also be used for Docker secrets. When a Docker swarm service is granted access to a secret, the secret gets mounted into the container. For example, if a secret named db.password is mounted at location /run/secrets/, you can make db.password available to the Spring environment using the following:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### Property Placeholders

> The values in application.properties and application.yml are filtered through the existing
>
> Environment when they are used, so you can refer back to previously defined values (for example,
>
> from System properties). The standard \${name} property-placeholder syntax can be used anywhere within a value.
>
> For example, the following file will set app.description to "MyApp is a Spring Boot application":
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### TIP

> You can also use this technique to create "short" variants of existing Spring Boot properties. See the [*Use 'Short' Command Line Arguments*](\l) how-to for details.

##### Working with Multi-Document Files

> Spring Boot allows you to split a single physical file into multiple logical documents which are each added independently. Documents are processed in order, from top to bottom. Later documents can override the properties defined in earlier ones.
>
> For application.yml files, the standard YAML multi-document syntax is used. Three consecutive hyphens represent the end of one document, and the start of the next.
>
> For example, the following file has two logical documents:
>
> For application.properties files a special #\-\-- comment is used to mark the document splits:

##### NOTE

> Property file separators must not have any leading whitespace and must have exactly three hyphen characters. The lines immediately before and after the separator must not be comments.

##### TIP

> Multi-document property files are often used in conjunction with activation properties such as spring.config.activate.on-profile. See the [next section](\l) for details.

##### WARNING

> Multi-document property files cannot be loaded by using the \@PropertySource
>
> or \@TestPropertySource annotations.

##### Activation Properties

> It's sometimes useful to only activate a given get of properties when certain conditions are met. For example, you might have properties that are only relevant when a specific profile is active.
>
> You can conditionally activate a properties document using spring.config.activate.\*. The following activation properties are available:
>
> *Table 5. activation properties*

------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Property**        **Note**

  on-profile          A profile expression that must match for the document to be active.

  on-cloud-platform   The CloudPlatform that must be detected for the document to be active.
------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

> For example, the following specifies that the second document is only active when running on Kubernetes, and only when either the "prod" or "staging" profiles are active:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

### Encrypting Properties

> Spring Boot does not provide any built in support for encrypting property values, however, it does provide the hook points necessary to modify values contained in the Spring Environment. The
>
> EnvironmentPostProcessor interface allows you to manipulate the Environment before the application starts. See [Customize the Environment or ApplicationContext Before It Starts](\l) for details.
>
> If you're looking for a secure way to store credentials and passwords, the Spring Cloud Vault project provides support for storing externalized configuration in HashiCorp Vault.

### Working with YAML

> YAML is a superset of JSON and, as such, is a convenient format for specifying hierarchical configuration data. The SpringApplication class automatically supports YAML as an alternative to properties whenever you have the SnakeYAML library on your classpath.
>
> **NOTE** If you use "Starters", SnakeYAML is automatically provided by spring-boot-starter.

##### Mapping YAML to Properties

> YAML documents need to be converted from their hierarchical format to a flat structure that can be used with the Spring Environment. For example, consider the following YAML document:
>
> In order to access these properties from the Environment, they would be flattened as follows:
>
> Likewise, YAML lists also need to be flattened. They are represented as property keys with \[index\]
>
> dereferencers. For example, consider the following YAML:
>
> The preceding example would be transformed into these properties:

##### TIP

> Properties that use the \[index\] notation can be bound to Java List or Set objects using Spring Boot's Binder class. For more details see the "[Type-safe Configuration](\l) [Properties](\l)" section below.

##### WARNING

> YAML files cannot be loaded by using the \@PropertySource or \@TestPropertySource annotations. So, in the case that you need to load values that way, you need to use a properties file.

##### Directly Loading YAML

> Spring Framework provides two convenient classes that can be used to load YAML documents. The YamlPropertiesFactoryBean loads YAML as Properties and the YamlMapFactoryBean loads YAML as a Map.
>
> You can also use the YamlPropertySourceLoader class if you want to load YAML as a Spring
>
> PropertySource.

### Configuring Random Values

> The RandomValuePropertySource is useful for injecting random values (for example, into secrets or test cases). It can produce integers, longs, uuids, or strings, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> The random.int\* syntax is OPEN value (,max) CLOSE where the OPEN,CLOSE are any character and value,max are integers. If max is provided, then value is the minimum value and max is the maximum value (exclusive).

### Configuring System Environment Properties

> Spring Boot supports setting a prefix for environment properties. This is useful if the system environment is shared by multiple Spring Boot applications with different configuration requirements. The prefix for system environment properties can be set directly on SpringApplication.
>
> For example, if you set the prefix to input, a property such as remote.timeout will also be resolved as
>
> input.remote.timeout in the system environment.

### Type-safe Configuration Properties

> Using the \@Value(\"\${property}\") annotation to inject configuration properties can sometimes be cumbersome, especially if you are working with multiple properties or your data is hierarchical in nature. Spring Boot provides an alternative method of working with properties that lets strongly typed beans govern and validate the configuration of your application.
>
> **TIP** See also the [differences between](\l) [\@Value](\l) [and type-safe configuration properties](\l).

##### JavaBean properties binding

> It is possible to bind a bean declaring standard JavaBean properties as shown in the following example:
>
> }
>
> public void setRemoteAddress(InetAddress remoteAddress) { this.remoteAddress = remoteAddress;
>
> }
>
> public Security getSecurity() { return this.security;
>
> }
>
> public static class Security { private String username; private String password;
>
> private List\<String> roles = new ArrayList\<\>(Collections.singleton(\"USER\"));
>
> public String getUsername() { return this.username;
>
> }
>
> public void setUsername(String username) { this.username = username;
>
> }
>
> public String getPassword() { return this.password;
>
> }
>
> public void setPassword(String password) { this.password = password;
>
> }
>
> public List\<String> getRoles() { return this.roles;
>
> }
>
> public void setRoles(List\<String> roles) { this.roles = roles;
>
> }
>
> }
>
> }
>
> The preceding POJO defines the following properties:

-   my.service.enabled, with a value of false by default.

-   my.service.remote-address, with a type that can be coerced from String.

-   my.service.security.username, with a nested \"security\" object whose name is determined by the name of the property. In particular, the return type is not used at all there and could have been SecurityProperties.

-   my.service.security.password.

-   my.service.security.roles, with a collection of String that defaults to USER.

##### NOTE

> The properties that map to \@ConfigurationProperties classes available in Spring Boot, which are configured via properties files, YAML files, environment variables etc., are public API but the accessors (getters/setters) of the class itself are not meant to be used directly.

##### NOTE

> Such arrangement relies on a default empty constructor and getters and setters are usually mandatory, since binding is through standard Java Beans property descriptors, just like in Spring MVC. A setter may be omitted in the following cases:

-   Maps, as long as they are initialized, need a getter but not necessarily a setter, since they can be mutated by the binder.

-   Collections and arrays can be accessed either through an index (typically with YAML) or by using a single comma-separated value (properties). In the latter case, a setter is mandatory. We recommend to always add a setter for such types. If you initialize a collection, make sure it is not immutable (as in the preceding example).

-   If nested POJO properties are initialized (like the Security field in the preceding example), a setter is not required. If you want the binder to create the instance on the fly by using its default constructor, you need a setter.

> Some people use Project Lombok to add getters and setters automatically. Make sure that Lombok does not generate any particular constructor for such a type, as it is used automatically by the container to instantiate the object.
>
> Finally, only standard Java Bean properties are considered and binding on static properties is not supported.

##### Constructor binding

> The example in the previous section can be rewritten in an immutable fashion as shown in the following example:

#### public class MyProperties { private final boolean enabled;

> private final InetAddress remoteAddress; private final Security security;
>
> public MyProperties(boolean enabled, InetAddress remoteAddress, Security security)
>
> {
>
> this.enabled = enabled; this.remoteAddress = remoteAddress; this.security = security;
>
> }
>
> public boolean isEnabled() { return this.enabled;
>
> }
>
> public InetAddress getRemoteAddress() { return this.remoteAddress;
>
> }
>
> public Security getSecurity() { return this.security;
>
> }
>
> public static class Security { private final String username; private final String password; private final List\<String> roles;
>
> public Security(String username, String password, \@DefaultValue(\"USER\") List\<String> roles) {
>
> this.username = username; this.password = password; this.roles = roles;
>
> }
>
> public String getUsername() { return this.username;
>
> }
>
> public String getPassword() { return this.password;
>
> }
>
> In this setup, the \@ConstructorBinding annotation is used to indicate that constructor binding should be used. This means that the binder will expect to find a constructor with the parameters that you wish to have bound.
>
> Nested members of a \@ConstructorBinding class (such as Security in the example above) will also be bound via their constructor.
>
> Default values can be specified using \@DefaultValue and the same conversion service will be applied to coerce the String value to the target type of a missing property. By default, if no properties are bound to Security, the MyProperties instance will contain a null value for security. If you wish you return a non-null instance of Security even when no properties are bound to it, you can use an empty \@DefaultValue annotation to do so:

##### NOTE

> To use constructor binding the class must be enabled using \@EnableConfigurationProperties or configuration property scanning. You cannot use constructor binding with beans that are created by the regular Spring mechanisms (e.g. \@Component beans, beans created via \@Bean methods or beans loaded using \@Import)

##### TIP

> If you have more than one constructor for your class you can also use
>
> \@ConstructorBinding directly on the constructor that should be bound.

##### NOTE

> The use of java.util.Optional with \@ConfigurationProperties is not recommended as it is primarily intended for use as a return type. As such, it is not well-suited to configuration property injection. For consistency with properties of other types, if you do declare an Optional property and it has no value, null rather than an empty Optional will be bound.

##### Enabling \@ConfigurationProperties-annotated types

> Spring Boot provides infrastructure to bind \@ConfigurationProperties types and register them as
>
> beans. You can either enable configuration properties on a class-by-class basis or enable configuration property scanning that works in a similar manner to component scanning.
>
> Sometimes, classes annotated with \@ConfigurationProperties might not be suitable for scanning, for example, if you're developing your own auto-configuration or you want to enable them conditionally. In these cases, specify the list of types to process using the \@EnableConfigurationProperties annotation. This can be done on any \@Configuration class, as shown in the following example:
>
> To use configuration property scanning, add the \@ConfigurationPropertiesScan annotation to your application. Typically, it is added to the main application class that is annotated with \@SpringBootApplication but it can be added to any \@Configuration class. By default, scanning will occur from the package of the class that declares the annotation. If you want to define specific packages to scan, you can do so as shown in the following example:

##### NOTE

> When the \@ConfigurationProperties bean is registered using configuration property scanning or via \@EnableConfigurationProperties, the bean has a conventional name:
>
> \<prefix>-\<fqn>, where \<prefix> is the environment key prefix specified in the \@ConfigurationProperties annotation and \<fqn> is the fully qualified name of the bean. If the annotation does not provide any prefix, only the fully qualified name of
>
> the bean is used.
>
> The bean name in the example above is com.example.app- com.example.app.SomeProperties.
>
> We recommend that \@ConfigurationProperties only deal with the environment and, in particular, does not inject other beans from the context. For corner cases, setter injection can be used or any of the \*Aware interfaces provided by the framework (such as EnvironmentAware if you need access to the Environment). If you still want to inject other beans using the constructor, the configuration
>
> properties bean must be annotated with \@Component and use JavaBean-based property binding.

##### Using \@ConfigurationProperties-annotated types

> This style of configuration works particularly well with the SpringApplication external YAML configuration, as shown in the following example:
>
> To work with \@ConfigurationProperties beans, you can inject them in the same way as any other bean, as shown in the following example:

##### TIP

> Using \@ConfigurationProperties also lets you generate metadata files that can be used by IDEs to offer auto-completion for your own keys. See the [appendix](\l) for details.

##### Third-party Configuration

> As well as using \@ConfigurationProperties to annotate a class, you can also use it on public \@Bean methods. Doing so can be particularly useful when you want to bind properties to third-party components that are outside of your control.
>
> To configure a bean from the Environment properties, add \@ConfigurationProperties to its bean registration, as shown in the following example:
>
> Any JavaBean property defined with the another prefix is mapped onto that AnotherComponent bean in manner similar to the preceding SomeProperties example.

##### Relaxed Binding

> Spring Boot uses some relaxed rules for binding Environment properties to \@ConfigurationProperties beans, so there does not need to be an exact match between the Environment property name and the bean property name. Common examples where this is useful include dash-separated environment properties (for example, context-path binds to contextPath), and capitalized environment properties (for example, PORT binds to port).
>
> As an example, consider the following \@ConfigurationProperties class:
>
> With the preceding code, the following properties names can all be used:
>
> *Table 6. relaxed binding*

+-------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Property**                        | **Note**                                                                         |
+-------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| my.main- project.person.fir st-name | Kebab case, which is recommended for use in .properties and .yml files.          |
+-------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| my.main- project.person.fir stName  | Standard camel case syntax.                                                      |
+-------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| my.main- project.person.fir st_name | Underscore notation, which is an alternative format for use in .properties and   |
|                                     |                                                                                  |
|                                     | .yml files.                                                                      |
+-------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| MY_MAINPROJECT_PER SON_FIRSTNAME    | Upper case format, which is recommended when using system environment variables. |
+-------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

##### NOTE

> The prefix value for the annotation *must* be in kebab case (lowercase and separated by -, such as my.main-project.person).
>
> *Table 7. relaxed binding rules per property source*

----------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Property Source**     **Simple**                                                                                                 **List**

  Properties Files        Camel case, kebab case, or underscore notation                                                             Standard list syntax using \[ \] or comma-separated values

  YAML Files              Camel case, kebab case, or underscore notation                                                             Standard YAML list syntax or comma- separated values

  Environment Variables   Upper case format with underscore as the delimiter (see [Binding from](\l) [Environment Variables](\l)).   Numeric values surrounded by underscores (see [Binding from](\l) [Environment Variables](\l))

  System properties       Camel case, kebab case, or underscore notation                                                             Standard list syntax using \[ \] or comma-separated values
----------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### TIP

> We recommend that, when possible, properties are stored in lower-case kebab format, such as my.person.first-name=Rod.
>
> **Binding Maps**
>
> When binding to Map properties you may need to use a special bracket notation so that the original key value is preserved. If the key is not surrounded by \[\], any characters that are not alpha- numeric, - or . are removed.
>
> For example, consider binding the following properties to a Map\<String,String>:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### NOTE

> For YAML files, the brackets need to be surrounded by quotes for the keys to be parsed properly.
>
> The properties above will bind to a Map with /key1, /key2 and key3 as the keys in the map. The slash has been removed from key3 because it wasn't surrounded by square brackets.
>
> You may also occasionally need to use the bracket notation if your key contains a . and you are binding to non-scalar value. For example, binding a.b=c to Map\<String, Object> will return a Map with the entry {\"a\"={\"b\"=\"c\"}} whereas \[a.b\]=c will return a Map with the entry {\"a.b\"=\"c\"}.
>
> **Binding from Environment Variables**
>
> Most operating systems impose strict rules around the names that can be used for environment variables. For example, Linux shell variables can contain only letters (a to z or A to Z), numbers (0 to

9)  or the underscore character (\_). By convention, Unix shell variables will also have their names in

> UPPERCASE.
>
> Spring Boot's relaxed binding rules are, as much as possible, designed to be compatible with these naming restrictions.
>
> To convert a property name in the canonical-form to an environment variable name you can follow these rules:

-   Replace dots (.) with underscores (\_).

-   Remove any dashes (-).

-   Convert to uppercase.

> For example, the configuration property spring.main.log-startup-info would be an environment variable named SPRING_MAIN_LOGSTARTUPINFO.
>
> Environment variables can also be used when binding to object lists. To bind to a List, the element number should be surrounded with underscores in the variable name.
>
> For example, the configuration property my.service\[0\].other would use an environment variable
>
> named MY_SERVICE_0\_OTHER.

##### Merging Complex Types

> When lists are configured in more than one place, overriding works by replacing the entire list.
>
> For example, assume a MyPojo object with name and description attributes that are null by default. The following example exposes a list of MyPojo objects from MyProperties:
>
> Consider the following configuration:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> If the dev profile is not active, MyProperties.list contains one MyPojo entry, as previously defined. If the dev profile is enabled, however, the list *still* contains only one entry (with a name of my another name and a description of null). This configuration *does not* add a second MyPojo instance to the list, and it does not merge the items.
>
> When a List is specified in multiple profiles, the one with the highest priority (and only that one) is used. Consider the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> In the preceding example, if the dev profile is active, MyProperties.list contains *one* MyPojo entry (with a name of my another name and a description of null). For YAML, both comma-separated lists and YAML lists can be used for completely overriding the contents of the list.
>
> For Map properties, you can bind with property values drawn from multiple sources. However, for the same property in multiple sources, the one with the highest priority is used. The following example exposes a Map\<String, MyPojo> from MyProperties:
>
> Consider the following configuration:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> If the dev profile is not active, MyProperties.map contains one entry with key key1 (with a name of my name 1 and a description of my description 1). If the dev profile is enabled, however, map contains two entries with keys key1 (with a name of dev name 1 and a description of my description 1) and key2 (with a name of dev name 2 and a description of dev description 2).
>
> **NOTE** The preceding merging rules apply to properties from all property sources, and not just files.

##### Properties Conversion

> Spring Boot attempts to coerce the external application properties to the right type when it binds to the \@ConfigurationProperties beans. If you need custom type conversion, you can provide a ConversionService bean (with a bean named conversionService) or custom property editors (through a CustomEditorConfigurer bean) or custom Converters (with bean definitions annotated as \@ConfigurationPropertiesBinding).

##### NOTE

> As this bean is requested very early during the application lifecycle, make sure to limit the dependencies that your ConversionService is using. Typically, any dependency that you require may not be fully initialized at creation time. You may want to rename your custom ConversionService if it is not required for configuration keys coercion and only rely on custom converters qualified with \@ConfigurationPropertiesBinding.
>
> **Converting Durations**
>
> Spring Boot has dedicated support for expressing durations. If you expose a java.time.Duration
>
> property, the following formats in application properties are available:

-   A regular long representation (using milliseconds as the default unit unless a \@DurationUnit has been specified)

-   The standard ISO-8601 format used by java.time.Duration

-   A more readable format where the value and the unit are coupled (e.g. 10s means 10 seconds) Consider the following example:

> To specify a session timeout of 30 seconds, 30, PT30S and 30s are all equivalent. A read timeout of 500ms can be specified in any of the following form: 500, PT0.5S and 500ms.
>
> You can also use any of the supported units. These are:

-   ns for nanoseconds

-   us for microseconds

-   ms for milliseconds

-   s for seconds

-   m for minutes

-   h for hours

-   d for days

> The default unit is milliseconds and can be overridden using \@DurationUnit as illustrated in the sample above.
>
> If you prefer to use constructor binding, the same properties can be exposed, as shown in the following example:

##### TIP

> If you are upgrading a Long property, make sure to define the unit (using \@DurationUnit) if it isn't milliseconds. Doing so gives a transparent upgrade path while supporting a much richer format.
>
> **Converting periods**
>
> In addition to durations, Spring Boot can also work with java.time.Period type. The following formats can be used in application properties:

-   An regular int representation (using days as the default unit unless a \@PeriodUnit has been specified)

-   The standard ISO-8601 format used by java.time.Period

-   A simpler format where the value and the unit pairs are coupled (e.g. 1y3d means 1 year and 3 days)

> The following units are supported with the simple format:

-   y for years

-   m for months

-   w for weeks

-   d for days

> **NOTE** The java.time.Period type never actually stores the number of weeks, it is a shortcut that means "7 days".
>
> **Converting Data Sizes**
>
> Spring Framework has a DataSize value type that expresses a size in bytes. If you expose a DataSize
>
> property, the following formats in application properties are available:

-   A regular long representation (using bytes as the default unit unless a \@DataSizeUnit has been specified)

-   A more readable format where the value and the unit are coupled (e.g. 10MB means 10 megabytes)

> Consider the following example:
>
> To specify a buffer size of 10 megabytes, 10 and 10MB are equivalent. A size threshold of 256 bytes can be specified as 256 or 256B.
>
> You can also use any of the supported units. These are:

-   B for bytes

-   KB for kilobytes

-   MB for megabytes

-   GB for gigabytes

-   TB for terabytes

> The default unit is bytes and can be overridden using \@DataSizeUnit as illustrated in the sample above.
>
> If you prefer to use constructor binding, the same properties can be exposed, as shown in the following example:

##### TIP

> If you are upgrading a Long property, make sure to define the unit (using \@DataSizeUnit) if it isn't bytes. Doing so gives a transparent upgrade path while supporting a much richer format.

##### \@ConfigurationProperties Validation

> Spring Boot attempts to validate \@ConfigurationProperties classes whenever they are annotated with Spring's \@Validated annotation. You can use JSR-303 javax.validation constraint annotations directly on your configuration class. To do so, ensure that a compliant JSR-303 implementation is on your classpath and then add constraint annotations to your fields, as shown in the following example:

##### TIP

> You can also trigger validation by annotating the \@Bean method that creates the configuration properties with \@Validated.
>
> To ensure that validation is always triggered for nested properties, even when no properties are found, the associated field must be annotated with \@Valid. The following example builds on the preceding MyProperties example:

#### import java.net.InetAddress;

> import javax.validation.Valid;
>
> import javax.validation.constraints.NotEmpty; import javax.validation.constraints.NotNull;
>
> import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties; import org.springframework.validation.annotation.Validated;
>
> \@ConfigurationProperties(\"my.service\") \@Validated
>
> public class MyProperties {
>
> \@NotNull
>
> private InetAddress remoteAddress;
>
> \@Valid
>
> private final Security security = new Security();
>
> public InetAddress getRemoteAddress() { return this.remoteAddress;
>
> }
>
> public void setRemoteAddress(InetAddress remoteAddress) { this.remoteAddress = remoteAddress;
>
> }
>
> public Security getSecurity() { return this.security;
>
> }
>
> public static class Security { \@NotEmpty
>
> private String username;
>
> public String getUsername() { return this.username;
>
> }
>
> public void setUsername(String username) { this.username = username;
>
> }
>
> }
>
> }
>
> You can also add a custom Spring Validator by creating a bean definition called
>
> configurationPropertiesValidator. The \@Bean method should be declared static. The configuration
>
> properties validator is created very early in the application's lifecycle, and declaring the \@Bean method as static lets the bean be created without having to instantiate the \@Configuration class. Doing so avoids any problems that may be caused by early instantiation.

##### TIP

> The spring-boot-actuator module includes an endpoint that exposes all \@ConfigurationProperties beans. Point your web browser to /actuator/configprops or use the equivalent JMX endpoint. See the \"[Production ready features](\l)\" section for details.

##### \@ConfigurationProperties vs. \@Value

> The \@Value annotation is a core container feature, and it does not provide the same features as type- safe configuration properties. The following table summarizes the features that are supported by \@ConfigurationProperties and \@Value:

----------------------------------- ---------------------------- --------------------------------------
  **Feature**                         \@ConfigurationProperti es   \@Value

  [Relaxed binding](\l)               Yes                          Limited (see [note](\l) [below](\l))

  [Meta-data support](\l)             Yes                          No

  SpEL evaluation                     No                           Yes
----------------------------------- ---------------------------- --------------------------------------

##### NOTE

> If you do want to use \@Value, we recommend that you refer to property names using their canonical form (kebab-case using only lowercase letters). This will allow Spring Boot to use the same logic as it does when relaxed binding \@ConfigurationProperties. For example, \@Value(\"{demo.item-price}\") will pick up demo.item-price and demo.itemPrice forms from the application.properties file, as well as DEMO_ITEMPRICE from the system environment. If you used \@Value(\"{demo.itemPrice}\") instead, demo.item-price and DEMO_ITEMPRICE would not be considered.
>
> If you define a set of configuration keys for your own components, we recommend you group them in a POJO annotated with \@ConfigurationProperties. Doing so will provide you with structured, type-safe object that you can inject into your own beans.
>
> SpEL expressions from [application property files](\l) are not processed at time of parsing these files and populating the environment. However, it is possible to write a SpEL expression in \@Value. If the value of a property from an application property file is a SpEL expression, it will be evaluated when consumed via \@Value.

## Profiles

> Spring Profiles provide a way to segregate parts of your application configuration and make it be available only in certain environments. Any \@Component, \@Configuration or \@ConfigurationProperties can be marked with \@Profile to limit when it is loaded, as shown in the following example:

##### NOTE

> If \@ConfigurationProperties beans are registered via \@EnableConfigurationProperties instead of automatic scanning, the \@Profile annotation needs to be specified on the \@Configuration class that has the \@EnableConfigurationProperties annotation. In the case where \@ConfigurationProperties are scanned, \@Profile can be specified on the \@ConfigurationProperties class itself.
>
> You can use a spring.profiles.active Environment property to specify which profiles are active. You can specify the property in any of the ways described earlier in this chapter. For example, you could include it in your application.properties, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> You could also specify it on the command line by using the following switch:
>
> \--spring.profiles.active=dev,hsqldb.
>
> If no profile is active, a default profile is enabled. The name of the default profile is default and it can be tuned using the spring.profiles.default Environment property, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

1.  **Adding Active Profiles**

> The spring.profiles.active property follows the same ordering rules as other properties: The highest PropertySource wins. This means that you can specify active profiles in application.properties and then **replace** them by using the command line switch.
>
> Sometimes, it is useful to have properties that **add** to the active profiles rather than replace them. The SpringApplication entry point has a Java API for setting additional profiles (that is, on top of those activated by the spring.profiles.active property). See the setAdditionalProfiles() method in SpringApplication. Profile groups, which are described in the [next section](\l) can also be used to add active profiles if a given profile is active.

### Profile Groups

> Occasionally the profiles that you define and use in your application are too fine-grained and become cumbersome to use. For example, you might have proddb and prodmq profiles that you use to enable database and messaging features independently.
>
> To help with this, Spring Boot lets you define profile groups. A profile group allows you to define a logical name for a related group of profiles.
>
> For example, we can create a production group that consists of our proddb and prodmq profiles.
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> Our application can now be started using \--spring.profiles.active=production to active the
>
> production, proddb and prodmq profiles in one hit.

### Programmatically Setting Profiles

> You can programmatically set active profiles by calling SpringApplication.setAdditionalProfiles(...
>
> ) before your application runs. It is also possible to activate profiles by using Spring's
>
> ConfigurableEnvironment interface.

### Profile-specific Configuration Files

> Profile-specific variants of both application.properties (or application.yml) and files referenced through \@ConfigurationProperties are considered as files and loaded. See \"[Profile Specific Files](\l)\" for details.

## Logging

> Spring Boot uses Commons Logging for all internal logging but leaves the underlying log implementation open. Default configurations are provided for Java Util Logging, Log4J2, and Logback. In each case, loggers are pre-configured to use console output with optional file output also available.
>
> By default, if you use the "Starters", Logback is used for logging. Appropriate Logback routing is also included to ensure that dependent libraries that use Java Util Logging, Commons Logging, Log4J, or SLF4J all work correctly.

##### TIP

> There are a lot of logging frameworks available for Java. Do not worry if the above list seems confusing. Generally, you do not need to change your logging dependencies and the Spring Boot defaults work just fine.

##### TIP

> When you deploy your application to a servlet container or application server, logging performed via the Java Util Logging API is not routed into your application's logs. This prevents logging performed by the container or other applications that have been deployed to it from appearing in your application's logs.

1.  **Log Format**

> The default log output from Spring Boot resembles the following example:
>
> The following items are output:

-   Date and Time: Millisecond precision and easily sortable.

-   Log Level: ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, or TRACE.

-   Process ID.

-   A \-\-- separator to distinguish the start of actual log messages.

-   Thread name: Enclosed in square brackets (may be truncated for console output).

-   Logger name: This is usually the source class name (often abbreviated).

-   The log message.

> **NOTE** Logback does not have a FATAL level. It is mapped to ERROR.

### Console Output

> The default log configuration echoes messages to the console as they are written. By default, ERROR
>
> -level, WARN-level, and INFO-level messages are logged. You can also enable a "debug" mode by starting your application with a \--debug flag.
>
> **NOTE** You can also specify debug=true in your application.properties.
>
> When the debug mode is enabled, a selection of core loggers (embedded container, Hibernate, and Spring Boot) are configured to output more information. Enabling the debug mode does *not* configure your application to log all messages with DEBUG level.
>
> Alternatively, you can enable a "trace" mode by starting your application with a \--trace flag (or trace=true in your application.properties). Doing so enables trace logging for a selection of core loggers (embedded container, Hibernate schema generation, and the whole Spring portfolio).

##### Color-coded Output

> If your terminal supports ANSI, color output is used to aid readability. You can set
>
> spring.output.ansi.enabled to a supported value to override the auto-detection.
>
> Color coding is configured by using the %clr conversion word. In its simplest form, the converter colors the output according to the log level, as shown in the following example:
>
> The following table describes the mapping of log levels to colors:

----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  **Level**                           **Color**

  FATAL                               Red

  ERROR                               Red

  WARN                                Yellow

  INFO                                Green

  DEBUG                               Green

  TRACE                               Green
----------------------------------- -----------------------------------

> Alternatively, you can specify the color or style that should be used by providing it as an option to the conversion. For example, to make the text yellow, use the following setting:
>
> The following colors and styles are supported:

-   blue

-   cyan

-   faint

-   green

-   magenta

-   red

    1.  ### File Output

> By default, Spring Boot logs only to the console and does not write log files. If you want to write log files in addition to the console output, you need to set a logging.file.name or logging.file.path property (for example, in your application.properties).
>
> The following table shows how the logging.\* properties can be used together:
>
> *Table 8. Logging properties*

+---------------+--------------------+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| logging.file  | logging.file       | **Example** | **Description**                                                                                                    |
|               |                    |             |                                                                                                                    |
| .name         | .path              |             |                                                                                                                    |

| *(none)*      | Specific directory | /var/log    | Writes spring.log to the specified directory. Names can be an exact location or relative to the current directory. |

> Log files rotate when they reach 10 MB and, as with console output, ERROR-level, WARN-level, and INFO
>
> -level messages are logged by default.

##### TIP

> Logging properties are independent of the actual logging infrastructure. As a result, specific configuration keys (such as logback.configurationFile for Logback) are not managed by spring Boot.

### File Rotation

> If you are using the Logback, it's possible to fine-tune log rotation settings using your application.properties or application.yaml file. For all other logging system, you'll need to configure rotation settings directly yourself (for example, if you use Log4J2 then you could add a log4j.xml file).
>
> The following rotation policy properties are supported:

------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Name**                                                **Description**

  logging.logback.rollingpolicy.file-name- pattern        The filename pattern used to create log archives.

  logging.logback.rollingpolicy.clean-history- on-start   If log archive cleanup should occur when the application starts.

  logging.logback.rollingpolicy.max-file-size             The maximum size of log file before it's archived.

  logging.logback.rollingpolicy.total-size-cap            The maximum amount of size log archives can take before being deleted.

  logging.logback.rollingpolicy.max-history               The number of days to keep log archives (defaults to 7)
------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Log Levels

> All the supported logging systems can have the logger levels set in the Spring Environment (for example, in application.properties) by using logging.level.\<logger-name>=\<level> where level is one of TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL, or OFF. The root logger can be configured by using logging.level.root.
>
> The following example shows potential logging settings in application.properties:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> It's also possible to set logging levels using environment variables. For example,
>
> LOGGING_LEVEL_ORG_SPRINGFRAMEWORK_WEB=DEBUG will set org.springframework.web to DEBUG.

##### NOTE

> The above approach will only work for package level logging. Since relaxed binding always converts environment variables to lowercase, it's not possible to configure logging for an individual class in this way. If you need to configure logging for a class, you can use [the](\l) [SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON](\l) variable.

### Log Groups

> It's often useful to be able to group related loggers together so that they can all be configured at the same time. For example, you might commonly change the logging levels for *all* Tomcat related loggers, but you can't easily remember top level packages.
>
> To help with this, Spring Boot allows you to define logging groups in your Spring Environment. For example, here's how you could define a "tomcat" group by adding it to your application.properties:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> Once defined, you can change the level for all the loggers in the group with a single line:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> Spring Boot includes the following pre-defined logging groups that can be used out-of-the-box:

-------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Name**       **Loggers**

  web            org.springframework.core.codec, org.springframework.http, org.springframework.web, org.springframework.boot.actuate.endpoint.web, org.springframework.boot.web.servlet.ServletContextInitializerBeans

  sql            org.springframework.jdbc.core, org.hibernate.SQL, org.jooq.tools.LoggerListener
-------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Using a Log Shutdown Hook

> In order to release logging resources when your application terminates, a shutdown hook that will trigger log system cleanup when the JVM exits is provided. This shutdown hook is registered automatically unless your application is deployed as a war file. If your application has complex context hierarchies the shutdown hook may not meet your needs. If it does not, disable the shutdown hook and investigate the options provided directly by the underlying logging system. For example, Logback offers context selectors which allow each Logger to be created in its own context. You can use the logging.register-shutdown-hook property to disable the shutdown hook. Setting it to false will disable the registration. You can set the property in your application.properties or application.yaml file:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

### Custom Log Configuration

> The various logging systems can be activated by including the appropriate libraries on the classpath and can be further customized by providing a suitable configuration file in the root of the classpath or in a location specified by the following Spring Environment property: logging.config.
>
> You can force Spring Boot to use a particular logging system by using the org.springframework.boot.logging.LoggingSystem system property. The value should be the fully qualified class name of a LoggingSystem implementation. You can also disable Spring Boot's logging configuration entirely by using a value of none.

##### NOTE

> Since logging is initialized **before** the ApplicationContext is created, it is not possible to control logging from \@PropertySources in Spring \@Configuration files. The only way to change the logging system or disable it entirely is via System properties.
>
> Depending on your logging system, the following files are loaded:

----------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Logging System**                  **Customization**

  Logback                             logback-spring.xml, logback-spring.groovy, logback.xml, or logback.groovy

  Log4j2                              log4j2-spring.xml or log4j2.xml

  JDK (Java Util Logging)             logging.properties
----------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### NOTE

> When possible, we recommend that you use the -spring variants for your logging configuration (for example, logback-spring.xml rather than logback.xml). If you use standard configuration locations, Spring cannot completely control log initialization.

##### WARNING

> There are known classloading issues with Java Util Logging that cause problems when running from an \'executable jar\'. We recommend that you avoid it when running from an \'executable jar\' if at all possible.
>
> To help with the customization, some other properties are transferred from the Spring Environment

> All the supported logging systems can consult System properties when parsing their configuration files. See the default configurations in spring-boot.jar for examples:

-   Logback

-   Log4j 2

-   Java Util logging

##### TIP

> If you want to use a placeholder in a logging property, you should use [Spring Boot's](\l) [syntax](\l) and not the syntax of the underlying framework. Notably, if you use Logback, you should use : as the delimiter between a property name and its default value and not use :-.
>
> You can add MDC and other ad-hoc content to log lines by overriding only the LOG_LEVEL_PATTERN (or logging.pattern.level with Logback). For example, if you use logging.pattern.level=user:%X{user} %5p, then the default log format contains an MDC entry for \"user\", if it exists, as shown in the following example.

##### TIP

1.  **Logback Extensions**

> Spring Boot includes a number of extensions to Logback that can help with advanced configuration. You can use these extensions in your logback-spring.xml configuration file.

##### NOTE

> Because the standard logback.xml configuration file is loaded too early, you cannot use extensions in it. You need to either use logback-spring.xml or define a logging.config property.

##### WARNING

> The extensions cannot be used with Logback's configuration scanning. If you attempt to do so, making changes to the configuration file results in an error similar to one of the following being logged:

##### Profile-specific Configuration

> The \<springProfile> tag lets you optionally include or exclude sections of configuration based on the active Spring profiles. Profile sections are supported anywhere within the \<configuration> element. Use the name attribute to specify which profile accepts the configuration. The
>
> \<springProfile> tag can contain a profile name (for example staging) or a profile expression. A profile expression allows for more complicated profile logic to be expressed, for example production & (eu-central \| eu-west). Check the reference guide for more details. The following listing shows three sample profiles:

##### Environment Properties

> The \<springProperty> tag lets you expose properties from the Spring Environment for use within Logback. Doing so can be useful if you want to access values from your application.properties file in your Logback configuration. The tag works in a similar way to Logback's standard \<property> tag. However, rather than specifying a direct value, you specify the source of the property (from the Environment). If you need to store the property somewhere other than in local scope, you can use the scope attribute. If you need a fallback value (in case the property is not set in the Environment), you can use the defaultValue attribute. The following example shows how to expose properties for use within Logback:

##### NOTE

> The source must be specified in kebab case (such as my.property-name). However, properties can be added to the Environment by using the relaxed rules.

## Internationalization

> Spring Boot supports localized messages so that your application can cater to users of different language preferences. By default, Spring Boot looks for the presence of a messages resource bundle at the root of the classpath.

##### NOTE

> The auto-configuration applies when the default properties file for the configured resource bundle is available (i.e. messages.properties by default). If your resource bundle contains only language-specific properties files, you are required to add the default. If no properties file is found that matches any of the configured base names, there will be no auto-configured MessageSource.
>
> The basename of the resource bundle as well as several other attributes can be configured using the spring.messages namespace, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### TIP

> spring.messages.basename supports comma-separated list of locations, either a package qualifier or a resource resolved from the classpath root.
>
> See MessageSourceProperties for more supported options.

## JSON

> Spring Boot provides integration with three JSON mapping libraries:

-   Gson

-   Jackson

-   JSON-B

> Jackson is the preferred and default library.

### Jackson

> Auto-configuration for Jackson is provided and Jackson is part of spring-boot-starter-json. When Jackson is on the classpath an ObjectMapper bean is automatically configured. Several configuration properties are provided for [customizing the configuration of the](\l) [ObjectMapper](\l).

### Gson

> Auto-configuration for Gson is provided. When Gson is on the classpath a Gson bean is automatically configured. Several spring.gson.\* configuration properties are provided for customizing the configuration. To take more control, one or more GsonBuilderCustomizer beans can be used.

### JSON-B

> Auto-configuration for JSON-B is provided. When the JSON-B API and an implementation are on the classpath a Jsonb bean will be automatically configured. The preferred JSON-B implementation is Apache Johnzon for which dependency management is provided.

## Developing Web Applications

> Spring Boot is well suited for web application development. You can create a self-contained HTTP server by using embedded Tomcat, Jetty, Undertow, or Netty. Most web applications use the spring- boot-starter-web module to get up and running quickly. You can also choose to build reactive web applications by using the spring-boot-starter-webflux module.
>
> If you have not yet developed a Spring Boot web application, you can follow the \"Hello World!\" example in the [*Getting started*](\l) section.

### The "Spring Web MVC Framework"

> The Spring Web MVC framework (often referred to as "Spring MVC") is a rich "model view controller" web framework. Spring MVC lets you create special \@Controller or \@RestController beans to handle incoming HTTP requests. Methods in your controller are mapped to HTTP by using \@RequestMapping annotations.
>
> The following code shows a typical \@RestController that serves JSON data:

#### import java.util.List;

> import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.DeleteMapping; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PathVariable; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
>
> \@RestController \@RequestMapping(\"/users\") public class MyRestController {
>
> private final UserRepository userRepository;
>
> private final CustomerRepository customerRepository;
>
> public MyRestController(UserRepository userRepository, CustomerRepository customerRepository) {
>
> this.userRepository = userRepository; this.customerRepository = customerRepository;
>
> }
>
> \@GetMapping(\"/{user}\")
>
> public User getUser(\@PathVariable Long userId) { return this.userRepository.findById(userId).get();
>
> }
>
> \@GetMapping(\"/{user}/customers\")
>
> public List\<Customer> getUserCustomers(\@PathVariable Long userId) { return
>
> this.userRepository.findById(userId).map(this.customerRepository::findByUser).get();
>
> }
>
> \@DeleteMapping(\"/{user}\")
>
> public void deleteUser(\@PathVariable Long userId) { this.userRepository.deleteById(userId);
>
> }
>
> }
>
> Spring MVC is part of the core Spring Framework, and detailed information is available in the reference documentation. There are also several guides that cover Spring MVC available at spring.io/guides.

##### Spring MVC Auto-configuration

> Spring Boot provides auto-configuration for Spring MVC that works well with most applications. The auto-configuration adds the following features on top of Spring's defaults:

-   Inclusion of ContentNegotiatingViewResolver and BeanNameViewResolver beans.

-   Support for serving static resources, including support for WebJars (covered [later in this document](\l)).

-   Automatic registration of Converter, GenericConverter, and Formatter beans.

-   Support for HttpMessageConverters (covered [later in this document](\l)).

-   Automatic registration of MessageCodesResolver (covered [later in this document](\l)).

-   Static index.html support.

-   Automatic use of a ConfigurableWebBindingInitializer bean (covered [later in this document](\l)).

> If you want to keep those Spring Boot MVC customizations and make more MVC customizations (interceptors, formatters, view controllers, and other features), you can add your own \@Configuration class of type WebMvcConfigurer but **without** \@EnableWebMvc.
>
> If you want to provide custom instances of RequestMappingHandlerMapping, RequestMappingHandlerAdapter, or ExceptionHandlerExceptionResolver, and still keep the Spring Boot MVC customizations, you can declare a bean of type WebMvcRegistrations and use it to provide custom instances of those components.
>
> If you want to take complete control of Spring MVC, you can add your own \@Configuration annotated with \@EnableWebMvc, or alternatively add your own \@Configuration-annotated DelegatingWebMvcConfiguration as described in the Javadoc of \@EnableWebMvc.

##### NOTE

> Spring MVC uses a different ConversionService to the one used to convert values from your application.properties or application.yaml file. It means that Period, Duration and DataSize converters are not available and that \@DurationUnit and \@DataSizeUnit annotations will be ignored.
>
> If you want to customize the ConversionService used by Spring MVC, you can provide a WebMvcConfigurer bean with an addFormatters method. From this method you can register any converter that you like, or you can delegate to the static methods available on ApplicationConversionService.

##### HttpMessageConverters

> Spring MVC uses the HttpMessageConverter interface to convert HTTP requests and responses. Sensible defaults are included out of the box. For example, objects can be automatically converted to JSON (by using the Jackson library) or XML (by using the Jackson XML extension, if available, or by using JAXB if the Jackson XML extension is not available). By default, strings are encoded in UTF- 8.
>
> If you need to add or customize converters, you can use Spring Boot's HttpMessageConverters class, as shown in the following listing:
>
> Any HttpMessageConverter bean that is present in the context is added to the list of converters. You can also override default converters in the same way.

##### Custom JSON Serializers and Deserializers

> If you use Jackson to serialize and deserialize JSON data, you might want to write your own JsonSerializer and JsonDeserializer classes. Custom serializers are usually registered with Jackson through a module, but Spring Boot provides an alternative \@JsonComponent annotation that makes it easier to directly register Spring Beans.
>
> You can use the \@JsonComponent annotation directly on JsonSerializer, JsonDeserializer or KeyDeserializer implementations. You can also use it on classes that contain serializers/deserializers as inner classes, as shown in the following example:

#### import java.io.IOException;

> import com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonGenerator; import com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonParser;
>
> import com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonProcessingException; import com.fasterxml.jackson.core.ObjectCodec;
>
> import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.DeserializationContext; import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonDeserializer; import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode;
>
> import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonSerializer; import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.SerializerProvider;
>
> import org.springframework.boot.jackson.JsonComponent; \@JsonComponent
>
> public class MyJsonComponent {
>
> public static class Serializer extends JsonSerializer\<MyObject> { \@Override
>
> public void serialize(MyObject value, JsonGenerator jgen, SerializerProvider serializers) throws IOException {
>
> jgen.writeStringField(\"name\", value.getName()); jgen.writeNumberField(\"age\", value.getAge());
>
> }
>
> }
>
> public static class Deserializer extends JsonDeserializer\<MyObject> {
>
> \@Override
>
> public MyObject deserialize(JsonParser jsonParser, DeserializationContext
>
> ctxt)

}

> }
>
> throws IOException, JsonProcessingException { ObjectCodec codec = jsonParser.getCodec(); JsonNode tree = codec.readTree(jsonParser); String name = tree.get(\"name\").textValue();
>
> int age = tree.get(\"age\").intValue(); return new MyObject(name, age);
>
> }
>
> All \@JsonComponent beans in the ApplicationContext are automatically registered with Jackson. Because \@JsonComponent is meta-annotated with \@Component, the usual component-scanning rules apply.
>
> Spring Boot also provides JsonObjectSerializer and JsonObjectDeserializer base classes that
>
> provide useful alternatives to the standard Jackson versions when serializing objects. See
>
> JsonObjectSerializer and JsonObjectDeserializer in the Javadoc for details.
>
> The example above can be rewritten to use JsonObjectSerializer/JsonObjectDeserializer as follows:

#### import java.io.IOException;

> import com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonGenerator; import com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonParser; import com.fasterxml.jackson.core.ObjectCodec;
>
> import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.DeserializationContext; import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode;
>
> import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.SerializerProvider;
>
> import org.springframework.boot.jackson.JsonComponent;
>
> import org.springframework.boot.jackson.JsonObjectDeserializer; import org.springframework.boot.jackson.JsonObjectSerializer;
>
> \@JsonComponent
>
> public class MyJsonComponent {
>

##### MessageCodesResolver

> Spring MVC has a strategy for generating error codes for rendering error messages from binding errors: MessageCodesResolver. If you set the spring.mvc.message-codes-resolver-format property PREFIX_ERROR_CODE or POSTFIX_ERROR_CODE, Spring Boot creates one for you (see the enumeration in DefaultMessageCodesResolver.Format).

##### Static Content

> By default, Spring Boot serves static content from a directory called /static (or /public or
>
> /resources or /META-INF/resources) in the classpath or from the root of the ServletContext. It uses the ResourceHttpRequestHandler from Spring MVC so that you can modify that behavior by adding your own WebMvcConfigurer and overriding the addResourceHandlers method.
>
> In a stand-alone web application, the default servlet from the container is also enabled and acts as a fallback, serving content from the root of the ServletContext if Spring decides not to handle it. Most of the time, this does not happen (unless you modify the default MVC configuration), because Spring can always handle requests through the DispatcherServlet.
>
> By default, resources are mapped on /\*\*, but you can tune that with the spring.mvc.static-path- pattern property. For instance, relocating all resources to /resources/\*\* can be achieved as follows:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> You can also customize the static resource locations by using the spring.web.resources.static- locations property (replacing the default values with a list of directory locations). The root Servlet context path, \"/\", is automatically added as a location as well.
>
> In addition to the "standard" static resource locations mentioned earlier, a special case is made for Webjars content. Any resources with a path in /webjars/\*\* are served from jar files if they are packaged in the Webjars format.

##### TIP

> Do not use the src/main/webapp directory if your application is packaged as a jar. Although this directory is a common standard, it works **only** with war packaging, and it is silently ignored by most build tools if you generate a jar.
>
> Spring Boot also supports the advanced resource handling features provided by Spring MVC, allowing use cases such as cache-busting static resources or using version agnostic URLs for Webjars.
>
> To use version agnostic URLs for Webjars, add the webjars-locator-core dependency. Then declare
>
> your Webjar. Using jQuery as an example, adding \"/webjars/jquery/jquery.min.js\" results in
>
> \"/webjars/jquery/x.y.z/jquery.min.js\" where x.y.z is the Webjar version.
>
> **NOTE** If you use JBoss, you need to declare the webjars-locator-jboss-vfs dependency instead of the webjars-locator-core. Otherwise, all Webjars resolve as a 404.
>
> To use cache busting, the following configuration configures a cache busting solution for all static resources, effectively adding a content hash, such as \<link href=\"/css/spring- 2a2d595e6ed9a0b24f027f2b63b134d6.css\"/>, in URLs:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### NOTE

> Links to resources are rewritten in templates at runtime, thanks to a ResourceUrlEncodingFilter that is auto-configured for Thymeleaf and FreeMarker. You should manually declare this filter when using JSPs. Other template engines are currently not automatically supported but can be with custom template macros/helpers and the use of the ResourceUrlProvider.
>
> When loading resources dynamically with, for example, a JavaScript module loader, renaming files is not an option. That is why other strategies are also supported and can be combined. A \"fixed\" strategy adds a static version string in the URL without changing the file name, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> With this configuration, JavaScript modules located under \"/js/lib/\" use a fixed versioning strategy (\"/v12/js/lib/mymodule.js\"), while other resources still use the content one (\<link href=\"/css/spring-2a2d595e6ed9a0b24f027f2b63b134d6.css\"/>).
>
> See ResourceProperties for more supported options.
>
> **TIP** This feature has been thoroughly described in a dedicated blog post and in Spring Framework's reference documentation.

##### Welcome Page

> Spring Boot supports both static and templated welcome pages. It first looks for an index.html file in the configured static content locations. If one is not found, it then looks for an index template. If either is found, it is automatically used as the welcome page of the application.

##### Path Matching and Content Negotiation

> Spring MVC can map incoming HTTP requests to handlers by looking at the request path and matching it to the mappings defined in your application (for example, \@GetMapping annotations on Controller methods).
>
> Spring Boot chooses to disable suffix pattern matching by default, which means that requests like \"GET /projects/spring-boot.json\" won't be matched to \@GetMapping(\"/projects/spring-boot\") mappings. This is considered as a best practice for Spring MVC applications. This feature was mainly useful in the past for HTTP clients which did not send proper \"Accept\" request headers; we needed to make sure to send the correct Content Type to the client. Nowadays, Content Negotiation is much more reliable.
>
> There are other ways to deal with HTTP clients that don't consistently send proper \"Accept\" request headers. Instead of using suffix matching, we can use a query parameter to ensure that requests like \"GET /projects/spring-boot?format=json\" will be mapped to \@GetMapping(\"/projects/spring- boot\"):
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> Or if you prefer to use a different parameter name:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> Most standard media types are supported out-of-the-box, but you can also define new ones:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> Suffix pattern matching is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. If you understand the caveats and would still like your application to use suffix pattern matching, the following configuration is required:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> Alternatively, rather than open all suffix patterns, it's more secure to only support registered suffix patterns:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> As of Spring Framework 5.3, Spring MVC supports several implementation strategies for matching request paths to Controller handlers. It was previously only supporting the AntPathMatcher strategy, but it now also offers PathPatternParser. Spring Boot now provides a configuration property to choose and opt in the new strategy:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> For more details on why you should consider this new implementation, please check out the dedicated blog post.

##### NOTE

> PathPatternParser is an optimized implementation but restricts usage of some path patterns variants and is incompatible with suffix pattern matching (spring.mvc.pathmatch.use-suffix-pattern, spring.mvc.pathmatch.use-registered- suffix-pattern) or mapping the DispatcherServlet with a Servlet prefix (spring.mvc.servlet.path).

##### ConfigurableWebBindingInitializer

> Spring MVC uses a WebBindingInitializer to initialize a WebDataBinder for a particular request. If you create your own ConfigurableWebBindingInitializer \@Bean, Spring Boot automatically configures Spring MVC to use it.

##### Template Engines

> As well as REST web services, you can also use Spring MVC to serve dynamic HTML content. Spring MVC supports a variety of templating technologies, including Thymeleaf, FreeMarker, and JSPs. Also, many other templating engines include their own Spring MVC integrations.
>
> Spring Boot includes auto-configuration support for the following templating engines:

-   FreeMarker

-   Groovy

-   Thymeleaf

-   Mustache

> **TIP** If possible, JSPs should be avoided. There are several [known limitations](\l) when using them with embedded servlet containers.
>
> When you use one of these templating engines with the default configuration, your templates are picked up automatically from src/main/resources/templates.

##### TIP

> Depending on how you run your application, your IDE may order the classpath differently. Running your application in the IDE from its main method results in a different ordering than when you run your application by using Maven or Gradle or from its packaged jar. This can cause Spring Boot to fail to find the expected template. If you have this problem, you can reorder the classpath in the IDE to place the module's classes and resources first.

##### Error Handling

> By default, Spring Boot provides an /error mapping that handles all errors in a sensible way, and it is registered as a "global" error page in the servlet container. For machine clients, it produces a JSON response with details of the error, the HTTP status, and the exception message. For browser clients, there is a "whitelabel" error view that renders the same data in HTML format (to customize
>
> it, add a View that resolves to error).
>
> There are a number of server.error properties that can be set if you want to customize the default error handling behavior. See the ["Server Properties"](\l) section of the Appendix.
>
> To replace the default behavior completely, you can implement ErrorController and register a bean definition of that type or add a bean of type ErrorAttributes to use the existing mechanism but replace the contents.

##### TIP

> The BasicErrorController can be used as a base class for a custom ErrorController. This is particularly useful if you want to add a handler for a new content type (the default is to handle text/html specifically and provide a fallback for everything else). To do so, extend BasicErrorController, add a public method with a \@RequestMapping that has a produces attribute, and create a bean of your new type.
>
> You can also define a class annotated with \@ControllerAdvice to customize the JSON document to return for a particular controller and/or exception type, as shown in the following example:

#### import javax.servlet.RequestDispatcher; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;

> import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus; import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
>
> import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ControllerAdvice; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ExceptionHandler; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ResponseBody; import
>
> org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.method.annotation.ResponseEntityExceptionHandler;
>
> \@ControllerAdvice(basePackageClasses = SomeController.class)
>
> public class MyControllerAdvice extends ResponseEntityExceptionHandler {
>
> \@ResponseBody \@ExceptionHandler(MyException.class)
>
> public ResponseEntity\<?> handleControllerException(HttpServletRequest request, Throwable ex) {
>
> HttpStatus status = getStatus(request);
>
> return new ResponseEntity\<\>(new MyErrorBody(status.value(), ex.getMessage()),
>
> status);
>
> }
>
> private HttpStatus getStatus(HttpServletRequest request) { Integer code = (Integer)
>
> request.getAttribute(RequestDispatcher.ERROR_STATUS_CODE); HttpStatus status = HttpStatus.resolve(code);
>
> return (status != null) ? status : HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR;
>
> }
>
> }
>
> In the preceding example, if YourException is thrown by a controller defined in the same package as SomeController, a JSON representation of the CustomErrorType POJO is used instead of the ErrorAttributes representation.
>
> In some cases, errors handled at the controller level are not recorded by the [metrics infrastructure](\l). Applications can ensure that such exceptions are recorded with the request metrics by setting the handled exception as a request attribute:
>
> **Custom Error Pages**
>
> If you want to display a custom HTML error page for a given status code, you can add a file to an
>
> /error directory. Error pages can either be static HTML (that is, added under any of the static resource directories) or be built by using templates. The name of the file should be the exact status code or a series mask.
>
> For example, to map 404 to a static HTML file, your directory structure would be as follows:
>
> To map all 5xx errors by using a FreeMarker template, your directory structure would be as follows:
>
> For more complex mappings, you can also add beans that implement the ErrorViewResolver
>
> interface, as shown in the following example:
>
> You can also use regular Spring MVC features such as \@ExceptionHandler methods and
>
> \@ControllerAdvice. The ErrorController then picks up any unhandled exceptions.
>
> **Mapping Error Pages outside of Spring MVC**
>
> For applications that do not use Spring MVC, you can use the ErrorPageRegistrar interface to directly register ErrorPages. This abstraction works directly with the underlying embedded servlet container and works even if you do not have a Spring MVC DispatcherServlet.

#### import org.springframework.boot.web.server.ErrorPage;

> import org.springframework.boot.web.server.ErrorPageRegistrar; import org.springframework.boot.web.server.ErrorPageRegistry; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
>
> import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration; import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
>
> \@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false) public class MyErrorPagesConfiguration {
>

>
> public ErrorPageRegistrar errorPageRegistrar() { return this::registerErrorPages;
>
> }
>
> private void registerErrorPages(ErrorPageRegistry registry) { registry.addErrorPages(new ErrorPage(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST, \"/400\"));
>
> }
>
> }

##### NOTE

> If you register an ErrorPage with a path that ends up being handled by a Filter (as is common with some non-Spring web frameworks, like Jersey and Wicket), then the Filter has to be explicitly registered as an ERROR dispatcher, as shown in the following example:
>
> Note that the default FilterRegistrationBean does not include the ERROR dispatcher type.
>
> **Error handling in a war deployment**
>
> When deployed to a servlet container, Spring Boot uses its error page filter to forward a request with an error status to the appropriate error page. This is necessary as the Servlet specification does not provide an API for registering error pages. Depending on the container that you are deploying your war file to and the technologies that your application uses, some additional configuration may be required.
>
> The error page filter can only forward the request to the correct error page if the response has not already been committed. By default, WebSphere Application Server 8.0 and later commits the response upon successful completion of a servlet's service method. You should disable this behavior by setting com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.invokeFlushAfterService to false.
>
> If you are using Spring Security and want to access the principal in an error page, you must configure Spring Security's filter to be invoked on error dispatches. To do so, set the spring.security.filter.dispatcher-types property to async, error, forward, request.

##### Spring HATEOAS

> If you develop a RESTful API that makes use of hypermedia, Spring Boot provides auto- configuration for Spring HATEOAS that works well with most applications. The auto-configuration replaces the need to use \@EnableHypermediaSupport and registers a number of beans to ease building hypermedia-based applications, including a LinkDiscoverers (for client side support) and an ObjectMapper configured to correctly marshal responses into the desired representation. The ObjectMapper is customized by setting the various spring.jackson.\* properties or, if one exists, by a Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder bean.
>
> You can take control of Spring HATEOAS's configuration by using \@EnableHypermediaSupport. Note that doing so disables the ObjectMapper customization described earlier.

##### WARNING

> spring-boot-starter-hateoas is specific to Spring MVC and should not be combined with Spring WebFlux. In order to use Spring HATEOAS with Spring WebFlux, you can add a direct dependency on org.springframework.hateoas:spring-hateoas along with spring-boot-starter- webflux.

##### CORS Support

> Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a W3C specification implemented by most browsers that lets you specify in a flexible way what kind of cross-domain requests are authorized., instead of using some less secure and less powerful approaches such as IFRAME or JSONP.
>
> As of version 4.2, Spring MVC supports CORS. Using controller method CORS configuration with \@CrossOrigin annotations in your Spring Boot application does not require any specific configuration. Global CORS configuration can be defined by registering a WebMvcConfigurer bean with a customized addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry) method, as shown in the following example:

### The "Spring WebFlux Framework"

> Spring WebFlux is the new reactive web framework introduced in Spring Framework 5.0. Unlike Spring MVC, it does not require the Servlet API, is fully asynchronous and non-blocking, and implements the Reactive Streams specification through the Reactor project.
>
> Spring WebFlux comes in two flavors: functional and annotation-based. The annotation-based one is quite close to the Spring MVC model, as shown in the following example:

#### import reactor.core.publisher.Flux; import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

> import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.DeleteMapping; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PathVariable; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
>
> \@RestController \@RequestMapping(\"/users\") public class MyRestController {
>
> private final UserRepository userRepository;
>
> private final CustomerRepository customerRepository;
>
> public MyRestController(UserRepository userRepository, CustomerRepository customerRepository) {
>
> this.userRepository = userRepository; this.customerRepository = customerRepository;
>
> }
>
> \@GetMapping(\"/{user}\")
>
> public Mono\<User> getUser(\@PathVariable Long userId) { return this.userRepository.findById(userId);
>
> }
>
> \@GetMapping(\"/{user}/customers\")
>
> public Flux\<Customer> getUserCustomers(\@PathVariable Long userId) { return
>
> this.userRepository.findById(userId).flatMapMany(this.customerRepository::findByUser);
>
> }
>
> \@DeleteMapping(\"/{user}\")
>
> public void deleteUser(\@PathVariable Long userId) { this.userRepository.deleteById(userId);
>
> }
>
> }
>
> "WebFlux.fn", the functional variant, separates the routing configuration from the actual handling of the requests, as shown in the following example:

#### import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;

> import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration; import org.springframework.http.MediaType;
>
> import org.springframework.web.reactive.function.server.RequestPredicate; import org.springframework.web.reactive.function.server.RouterFunction; import org.springframework.web.reactive.function.server.ServerResponse;
>
> import static org.springframework.web.reactive.function.server.RequestPredicates.DELETE;
>
> import static org.springframework.web.reactive.function.server.RequestPredicates.GET; import static org.springframework.web.reactive.function.server.RequestPredicates.accept;
>
> import static org.springframework.web.reactive.function.server.RouterFunctions.route;
>
> \@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false) public class MyRoutingConfiguration {
>
> private static final RequestPredicate ACCEPT_JSON = accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON);
>
> \@Bean
>
> public RouterFunction\<ServerResponse> monoRouterFunction(MyUserHandler userHandler) {
>
> return route(
>
> GET(\"/{user}\").and(ACCEPT_JSON), userHandler::getUser).andRoute( GET(\"/{user}/customers\").and(ACCEPT_JSON),
>
> userHandler::getUserCustomers).andRoute(
>
> DELETE(\"/{user}\").and(ACCEPT_JSON), userHandler::deleteUser);
>
> }
>
> }
>
> WebFlux is part of the Spring Framework and detailed information is available in its reference documentation.
>
> **TIP** You can define as many RouterFunction beans as you like to modularize the definition of the router. Beans can be ordered if you need to apply a precedence.
>
> To get started, add the spring-boot-starter-webflux module to your application.

##### NOTE

> Adding both spring-boot-starter-web and spring-boot-starter-webflux modules in your application results in Spring Boot auto-configuring Spring MVC, not WebFlux. This behavior has been chosen because many Spring developers add spring-boot- starter-webflux to their Spring MVC application to use the reactive WebClient. You can still enforce your choice by setting the chosen application type to SpringApplication.setWebApplicationType(WebApplicationType.REACTIVE).

##### Spring WebFlux Auto-configuration

> Spring Boot provides auto-configuration for Spring WebFlux that works well with most applications.
>
> The auto-configuration adds the following features on top of Spring's defaults:

-   Configuring codecs for HttpMessageReader and HttpMessageWriter instances (described [later in this document](\l)).

-   Support for serving static resources, including support for WebJars (described [later in this](\l)

> [document](\l)).
>
> If you want to keep Spring Boot WebFlux features and you want to add additional WebFlux configuration, you can add your own \@Configuration class of type WebFluxConfigurer but **without** \@EnableWebFlux.
>
> If you want to take complete control of Spring WebFlux, you can add your own \@Configuration
>
> annotated with \@EnableWebFlux.

##### HTTP Codecs with HttpMessageReaders and HttpMessageWriters

> Spring WebFlux uses the HttpMessageReader and HttpMessageWriter interfaces to convert HTTP requests and responses. They are configured with CodecConfigurer to have sensible defaults by looking at the libraries available in your classpath.
>
> Spring Boot provides dedicated configuration properties for codecs, spring.codec.\*. It also applies further customization by using CodecCustomizer instances. For example, spring.jackson.\* configuration keys are applied to the Jackson codec.
>
> If you need to add or customize codecs, you can create a custom CodecCustomizer component, as shown in the following example:
>
> You can also leverage [Boot's custom JSON serializers and deserializers](\l).

##### Static Content

> By default, Spring Boot serves static content from a directory called /static (or /public or
>
> /resources or /META-INF/resources) in the classpath. It uses the ResourceWebHandler from Spring WebFlux so that you can modify that behavior by adding your own WebFluxConfigurer and overriding the addResourceHandlers method.
>
> By default, resources are mapped on /\*\*, but you can tune that by setting the spring.webflux.static-path-pattern property. For instance, relocating all resources to /resources/\*\* can be achieved as follows:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> You can also customize the static resource locations by using spring.web.resources.static- locations. Doing so replaces the default values with a list of directory locations. If you do so, the default welcome page detection switches to your custom locations. So, if there is an index.html in any of your locations on startup, it is the home page of the application.
>
> In addition to the "standard" static resource locations listed earlier, a special case is made for Webjars content. Any resources with a path in /webjars/\*\* are served from jar files if they are packaged in the Webjars format.
>
> **TIP** Spring WebFlux applications do not strictly depend on the Servlet API, so they cannot be deployed as war files and do not use the src/main/webapp directory.

##### Welcome Page

> Spring Boot supports both static and templated welcome pages. It first looks for an index.html file in the configured static content locations. If one is not found, it then looks for an index template. If either is found, it is automatically used as the welcome page of the application.

##### Template Engines

> As well as REST web services, you can also use Spring WebFlux to serve dynamic HTML content. Spring WebFlux supports a variety of templating technologies, including Thymeleaf, FreeMarker, and Mustache.
>
> Spring Boot includes auto-configuration support for the following templating engines:

-   FreeMarker

-   Thymeleaf

-   Mustache

> When you use one of these templating engines with the default configuration, your templates are picked up automatically from src/main/resources/templates.

##### Error Handling

> Spring Boot provides a WebExceptionHandler that handles all errors in a sensible way. Its position in the processing order is immediately before the handlers provided by WebFlux, which are considered last. For machine clients, it produces a JSON response with details of the error, the HTTP status, and the exception message. For browser clients, there is a "whitelabel" error handler that renders the same data in HTML format. You can also provide your own HTML templates to display errors (see the [next section](\l)).
>
> The first step to customizing this feature often involves using the existing mechanism but replacing or augmenting the error contents. For that, you can add a bean of type ErrorAttributes.
>
> To change the error handling behavior, you can implement ErrorWebExceptionHandler and register a bean definition of that type. Because a ErrorWebExceptionHandler is quite low-level, Spring Boot also provides a convenient AbstractErrorWebExceptionHandler to let you handle errors in a WebFlux functional way, as shown in the following example:

#### import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

##### Web Filters

> Spring WebFlux provides a WebFilter interface that can be implemented to filter HTTP request- response exchanges. WebFilter beans found in the application context will be automatically used to filter each exchange.
>
> Where the order of the filters is important they can implement Ordered or be annotated with \@Order. Spring Boot auto-configuration may configure web filters for you. When it does so, the orders shown in the following table will be used:

--------------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  **Web Filter**                          **Order**

  MetricsWebFilter                        Ordered.HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE + 1

  WebFilterChainProxy (Spring Security)   -100

  HttpTraceWebFilter                      Ordered.LOWEST_PRECEDENCE - 10
--------------------------------------- -----------------------------------

### JAX-RS and Jersey

> If you prefer the JAX-RS programming model for REST endpoints, you can use one of the available implementations instead of Spring MVC. Jersey and Apache CXF work quite well out of the box. CXF requires you to register its Servlet or Filter as a \@Bean in your application context. Jersey has some native Spring support, so we also provide auto-configuration support for it in Spring Boot, together with a starter.
>
> To get started with Jersey, include the spring-boot-starter-jersey as a dependency and then you need one \@Bean of type ResourceConfig in which you register all the endpoints, as shown in the following example:

##### WARNING

> Jersey's support for scanning executable archives is rather limited. For example, it cannot scan for endpoints in a package found in a [fully executable](\l) [jar file](\l) or in WEB-INF/classes when running an executable war file. To avoid this limitation, the packages method should not be used, and endpoints should be registered individually by using the register method, as shown in the preceding example.
>
> For more advanced customizations, you can also register an arbitrary number of beans that implement ResourceConfigCustomizer.
>
> All the registered endpoints should be \@Components with HTTP resource annotations (\@GET and others), as shown in the following example:
>
> Since the Endpoint is a Spring \@Component, its lifecycle is managed by Spring and you can use the \@Autowired annotation to inject dependencies and use the \@Value annotation to inject external configuration. By default, the Jersey servlet is registered and mapped to /\*. You can change the mapping by adding \@ApplicationPath to your ResourceConfig.
>
> By default, Jersey is set up as a Servlet in a \@Bean of type ServletRegistrationBean named jerseyServletRegistration. By default, the servlet is initialized lazily, but you can customize that behavior by setting spring.jersey.servlet.load-on-startup. You can disable or override that bean by creating one of your own with the same name. You can also use a filter instead of a servlet by setting spring.jersey.type=filter (in which case, the \@Bean to replace or override is jerseyFilterRegistration). The filter has an \@Order, which you can set with spring.jersey.filter.order. When using Jersey as a filter, a Servlet that will handle any requests that are not intercepted by Jersey must be present. If your application does not contain such a servlet, you may want to enable the default servlet by setting server.servlet.register-default- servlet to true. Both the servlet and the filter registrations can be given init parameters by using spring.jersey.init.\* to specify a map of properties.

### Embedded Servlet Container Support

> Spring Boot includes support for embedded Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow servers. Most developers use the appropriate "Starter" to obtain a fully configured instance. By default, the embedded server listens for HTTP requests on port 8080.

##### Servlets, Filters, and listeners

> When using an embedded servlet container, you can register servlets, filters, and all the listeners (such as HttpSessionListener) from the Servlet spec, either by using Spring beans or by scanning for Servlet components.
>
> **Registering Servlets, Filters, and Listeners as Spring Beans**
>
> Any Servlet, Filter, or servlet \*Listener instance that is a Spring bean is registered with the embedded container. This can be particularly convenient if you want to refer to a value from your application.properties during configuration.
>
> By default, if the context contains only a single Servlet, it is mapped to /. In the case of multiple servlet beans, the bean name is used as a path prefix. Filters map to /\*.
>
> If convention-based mapping is not flexible enough, you can use the ServletRegistrationBean, FilterRegistrationBean, and ServletListenerRegistrationBean classes for complete control.
>
> It is usually safe to leave Filter beans unordered. If a specific order is required, you should annotate the Filter with \@Order or make it implement Ordered. You cannot configure the order of a Filter by annotating its bean method with \@Order. If you cannot change the Filter class to add \@Order or implement Ordered, you must define a FilterRegistrationBean for the Filter and set the registration bean's order using the setOrder(int) method. Avoid configuring a Filter that reads the request body at Ordered.HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE, since it might go against the character encoding configuration of your application. If a Servlet filter wraps the request, it should be configured with an order that is less than or equal to OrderedFilter.REQUEST_WRAPPER_FILTER_MAX_ORDER.

##### TIP

> To see the order of every Filter in your application, enable debug level logging for the web [logging group](\l) (logging.level.web=debug). Details of the registered filters, including their order and URL patterns, will then be logged at startup.

##### WARNING

> Take care when registering Filter beans since they are initialized very early in the application lifecycle. If you need to register a Filter that interacts with other beans, consider using a DelegatingFilterProxyRegistrationBean instead.

##### Servlet Context Initialization

> Embedded servlet containers do not directly execute the Servlet 3.0+ javax.servlet.ServletContainerInitializer interface or Spring's org.springframework.web.WebApplicationInitializer interface. This is an intentional design decision intended to reduce the risk that third party libraries designed to run inside a war may break Spring Boot applications.
>
> If you need to perform servlet context initialization in a Spring Boot application, you should register a bean that implements the org.springframework.boot.web.servlet.ServletContextInitializer interface. The single onStartup method provides access to the ServletContext and, if necessary, can easily be used as an adapter to an existing WebApplicationInitializer.
>
> **Scanning for Servlets, Filters, and listeners**
>
> When using an embedded container, automatic registration of classes annotated with \@WebServlet, \@WebFilter, and \@WebListener can be enabled by using \@ServletComponentScan.
>
> **TIP** \@ServletComponentScan has no effect in a standalone container, where the container's built-in discovery mechanisms are used instead.

##### The ServletWebServerApplicationContext

> Under the hood, Spring Boot uses a different type of ApplicationContext for embedded servlet container support. The ServletWebServerApplicationContext is a special type of WebApplicationContext that bootstraps itself by searching for a single ServletWebServerFactory bean. Usually a TomcatServletWebServerFactory, JettyServletWebServerFactory, or UndertowServletWebServerFactory has been auto-configured.

##### NOTE

> You usually do not need to be aware of these implementation classes. Most applications are auto-configured, and the appropriate ApplicationContext and ServletWebServerFactory are created on your behalf.

##### Customizing Embedded Servlet Containers

> Common servlet container settings can be configured by using Spring Environment properties. Usually, you would define the properties in your application.properties or application.yaml file.
>
> Common server settings include:

-   Network settings: Listen port for incoming HTTP requests (server.port), interface address to bind to server.address, and so on.

-   Session settings: Whether the session is persistent (server.servlet.session.persistent), session

> timeout (server.servlet.session.timeout), location of session data (server.servlet.session.store-dir), and session-cookie configuration (server.servlet.session.cookie.\*).

-   Error management: Location of the error page (server.error.path) and so on.

-   [SSL](\l)

-   [HTTP compression](\l)

> Spring Boot tries as much as possible to expose common settings, but this is not always possible. For those cases, dedicated namespaces offer server-specific customizations (see server.tomcat and server.undertow). For instance, [access logs](\l) can be configured with specific features of the embedded servlet container.
>
> **TIP** See the ServerProperties class for a complete list.
>
> **Programmatic Customization**
>
> If you need to programmatically configure your embedded servlet container, you can register a Spring bean that implements the WebServerFactoryCustomizer interface. WebServerFactoryCustomizer provides access to the ConfigurableServletWebServerFactory, which includes numerous customization setter methods. The following example shows programmatically setting the port:
>
> TomcatServletWebServerFactory, JettyServletWebServerFactory and UndertowServletWebServerFactory are dedicated variants of ConfigurableServletWebServerFactory that have additional customization setter methods for Tomcat, Jetty and Undertow respectively. The following example shows how to customize TomcatServletWebServerFactory that provides access to Tomcat-specific configuration options:
>
> **Customizing ConfigurableServletWebServerFactory Directly**
>
> For more advanced use cases that require you to extend from ServletWebServerFactory, you can expose a bean of such type yourself.
>
> Setters are provided for many configuration options. Several protected method "hooks" are also provided should you need to do something more exotic. See the source code documentation for details.
>
> **NOTE** Auto-configured customizers are still applied on your custom factory, so use that option carefully.

##### JSP Limitations

> When running a Spring Boot application that uses an embedded servlet container (and is packaged as an executable archive), there are some limitations in the JSP support.

-   With Jetty and Tomcat, it should work if you use war packaging. An executable war will work when launched with java -jar, and will also be deployable to any standard container. JSPs are not supported when using an executable jar.

-   Undertow does not support JSPs.

-   Creating a custom error.jsp page does not override the default view for [error handling](\l). [Custom error pages](\l) should be used instead.

    1.  ### Embedded Reactive Server Support

> Spring Boot includes support for the following embedded reactive web servers: Reactor Netty, Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow. Most developers use the appropriate "Starter" to obtain a fully configured instance. By default, the embedded server listens for HTTP requests on port 8080.

### Reactive Server Resources Configuration

> When auto-configuring a Reactor Netty or Jetty server, Spring Boot will create specific beans that will provide HTTP resources to the server instance: ReactorResourceFactory or JettyResourceFactory.
>
> By default, those resources will be also shared with the Reactor Netty and Jetty clients for optimal performances, given:

-   the same technology is used for server and client

-   the client instance is built using the WebClient.Builder bean auto-configured by Spring Boot

> Developers can override the resource configuration for Jetty and Reactor Netty by providing a custom ReactorResourceFactory or JettyResourceFactory bean - this will be applied to both clients and servers.
>
> You can learn more about the resource configuration on the client side in the [WebClient Runtime](\l) [section](\l).

## Graceful shutdown

> Graceful shutdown is supported with all four embedded web servers (Jetty, Reactor Netty, Tomcat, and Undertow) and with both reactive and Servlet-based web applications. It occurs as part of closing the application context and is performed in the earliest phase of stopping SmartLifecycle beans. This stop processing uses a timeout which provides a grace period during which existing requests will be allowed to complete but no new requests will be permitted. The exact way in which new requests are not permitted varies depending on the web server that is being used. Jetty, Reactor Netty, and Tomcat will stop accepting requests at the network layer. Undertow will accept requests but respond immediately with a service unavailable (503) response.
>
> **NOTE** Graceful shutdown with Tomcat requires Tomcat 9.0.33 or later.
>
> To enable graceful shutdown, configure the server.shutdown property, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> To configure the timeout period, configure the spring.lifecycle.timeout-per-shutdown-phase
>
> property, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### IMPORTANT

> Using graceful shutdown with your IDE may not work properly if it does not send a proper SIGTERM signal. Refer to the documentation of your IDE for more details.

## RSocket

> RSocket is a binary protocol for use on byte stream transports. It enables symmetric interaction models via async message passing over a single connection.
>
> The spring-messaging module of the Spring Framework provides support for RSocket requesters and responders, both on the client and on the server side. See the RSocket section of the Spring Framework reference for more details, including an overview of the RSocket protocol.

### RSocket Strategies Auto-configuration

> Spring Boot auto-configures an RSocketStrategies bean that provides all the required infrastructure for encoding and decoding RSocket payloads. By default, the auto-configuration will try to configure the following (in order):

1.  CBOR codecs with Jackson

2.  JSON codecs with Jackson

> The spring-boot-starter-rsocket starter provides both dependencies. Check out the [Jackson support](\l) [section](\l) to know more about customization possibilities.
>
> Developers can customize the RSocketStrategies component by creating beans that implement the RSocketStrategiesCustomizer interface. Note that their \@Order is important, as it determines the order of codecs.

### RSocket server Auto-configuration

> Spring Boot provides RSocket server auto-configuration. The required dependencies are provided by the spring-boot-starter-rsocket.
>
> Spring Boot allows exposing RSocket over WebSocket from a WebFlux server, or standing up an independent RSocket server. This depends on the type of application and its configuration.
>
> For WebFlux application (i.e. of type WebApplicationType.REACTIVE), the RSocket server will be
>
> plugged into the Web Server only if the following properties match:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### WARNING

> Plugging RSocket into a web server is only supported with Reactor Netty, as RSocket itself is built with that library.
>
> Alternatively, an RSocket TCP or websocket server is started as an independent, embedded server. Besides the dependency requirements, the only required configuration is to define a port for that server:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

### Spring Messaging RSocket support

> Spring Boot will auto-configure the Spring Messaging infrastructure for RSocket.
>
> This means that Spring Boot will create a RSocketMessageHandler bean that will handle RSocket requests to your application.

### Calling RSocket Services with RSocketRequester

> Once the RSocket channel is established between server and client, any party can send or receive requests to the other.
>
> As a server, you can get injected with an RSocketRequester instance on any handler method of an RSocket \@Controller. As a client, you need to configure and establish an RSocket connection first. Spring Boot auto-configures an RSocketRequester.Builder for such cases with the expected codecs.
>
> The RSocketRequester.Builder instance is a prototype bean, meaning each injection point will provide you with a new instance . This is done on purpose since this builder is stateful and you shouldn't create requesters with different setups using the same instance.
>
> The following code shows a typical example:

## Security

> If Spring Security is on the classpath, then web applications are secured by default. Spring Boot relies on Spring Security's content-negotiation strategy to determine whether to use httpBasic or formLogin. To add method-level security to a web application, you can also add \@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity with your desired settings. Additional information can be found in the Spring Security Reference Guide.
>
> The default UserDetailsService has a single user. The user name is user, and the password is random and is printed at INFO level when the application starts, as shown in the following example:

##### NOTE

> If you fine-tune your logging configuration, ensure that the org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.security category is set to log INFO-level messages. Otherwise, the default password is not printed.
>
> You can change the username and password by providing a spring.security.user.name and
>
> spring.security.user.password.
>
> The basic features you get by default in a web application are:

-   A UserDetailsService (or ReactiveUserDetailsService in case of a WebFlux application) bean with in-memory store and a single user with a generated password (see SecurityProperties.User for the properties of the user).

-   Form-based login or HTTP Basic security (depending on the Accept header in the request) for the entire application (including actuator endpoints if actuator is on the classpath).

-   A DefaultAuthenticationEventPublisher for publishing authentication events. You can provide a different AuthenticationEventPublisher by adding a bean for it.

    1.  **MVC Security**

> The default security configuration is implemented in SecurityAutoConfiguration and UserDetailsServiceAutoConfiguration. SecurityAutoConfiguration imports SpringBootWebSecurityConfiguration for web security and UserDetailsServiceAutoConfiguration configures authentication, which is also relevant in non-web applications. To switch off the default web application security configuration completely or to combine multiple Spring Security components such as OAuth2 Client and Resource Server, add a bean of type SecurityFilterChain (doing so does not disable the UserDetailsService configuration or Actuator's security).
>
> To also switch off the UserDetailsService configuration, you can add a bean of type
>
> UserDetailsService, AuthenticationProvider, or AuthenticationManager.
>
> Access rules can be overridden by adding a custom SecurityFilterChain or WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter bean. Spring Boot provides convenience methods that can be used to override access rules for actuator endpoints and static resources. EndpointRequest can be used to create a RequestMatcher that is based on the management.endpoints.web.base-path property. PathRequest can be used to create a RequestMatcher for resources in commonly used locations.

### WebFlux Security

> Similar to Spring MVC applications, you can secure your WebFlux applications by adding the spring-boot-starter-security dependency. The default security configuration is implemented in ReactiveSecurityAutoConfiguration and UserDetailsServiceAutoConfiguration. ReactiveSecurityAutoConfiguration imports WebFluxSecurityConfiguration for web security and UserDetailsServiceAutoConfiguration configures authentication, which is also relevant in non-web applications. To switch off the default web application security configuration completely, you can add a bean of type WebFilterChainProxy (doing so does not disable the UserDetailsService configuration or Actuator's security).
>
> To also switch off the UserDetailsService configuration, you can add a bean of type
>
> ReactiveUserDetailsService or ReactiveAuthenticationManager.
>
> Access rules and the use of multiple Spring Security components such as OAuth 2 Client and Resource Server can be configured by adding a custom SecurityWebFilterChain bean. Spring Boot provides convenience methods that can be used to override access rules for actuator endpoints and static resources. EndpointRequest can be used to create a ServerWebExchangeMatcher that is based on
>
> the management.endpoints.web.base-path property.
>
> PathRequest can be used to create a ServerWebExchangeMatcher for resources in commonly used locations.
>
> For example, you can customize your security configuration by adding something like:

#### import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.security.reactive.PathRequest; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;

> import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
>
> import org.springframework.security.config.web.server.ServerHttpSecurity; import org.springframework.security.web.server.SecurityWebFilterChain;
>
> \@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false) public class MyWebFluxSecurityConfiguration {
>
> \@Bean
>
> public SecurityWebFilterChain springSecurityFilterChain(ServerHttpSecurity http) { http.authorizeExchange((spec) -\> {
>
> spec.matchers(PathRequest.toStaticResources().atCommonLocations()).permitAll(); spec.pathMatchers(\"/foo\", \"/bar\").authenticated();
>
> });
>
> http.formLogin(); return http.build();
>
> }
>
> }

3.  **OAuth2**

> OAuth2 is a widely used authorization framework that is supported by Spring.

##### Client

> If you have spring-security-oauth2-client on your classpath, you can take advantage of some auto- configuration to set up an OAuth2/Open ID Connect clients. This configuration makes use of the properties under OAuth2ClientProperties. The same properties are applicable to both servlet and reactive applications.
>
> You can register multiple OAuth2 clients and providers under the spring.security.oauth2.client
>
> prefix, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*

#### spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-1.client-id=abcd spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-1.client-secret=password spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-1.client-name=Client for user scope

> spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-1.provider=my-oauth-provider spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-1.scope=user spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-1.redirect-uri=https://my- redirect-uri.com
>
> spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-1.client-authentication- method=basic
>
> spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-1.authorization-grant- type=authorization-code
>
> spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-2.client-id=abcd spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-2.client-secret=password spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-2.client-name=Client for email scope
>
> spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-2.provider=my-oauth-provider spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-2.scope=email spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-2.redirect-uri=https://my- redirect-uri.com
>
> spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-2.client-authentication- method=basic
>
> spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-2.authorization-grant- type=authorization_code
>
> spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.my-oauth-provider.authorization-uri=https://my- auth-server/oauth/authorize
>
> spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.my-oauth-provider.token-uri=https://my-auth- server/oauth/token
>
> spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.my-oauth-provider.user-info-uri=https://my- auth-server/userinfo
>
> spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.my-oauth-provider.user-info-authentication- method=header
>
> spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.my-oauth-provider.jwk-set-uri=https://my-auth- server/token_keys
>
> spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.my-oauth-provider.user-name-attribute=name
>
> *Yaml*
>
> For OpenID Connect providers that support OpenID Connect discovery, the configuration can be further simplified. The provider needs to be configured with an issuer-uri which is the URI that the it asserts as its Issuer Identifier. For example, if the issuer-uri provided is \"https://example.com\", then an OpenID Provider Configuration Request will be made to \"https://example.com/.well- known/openid-configuration\". The result is expected to be an OpenID Provider Configuration Response. The following example shows how an OpenID Connect Provider can be configured with the issuer-uri:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> By default, Spring Security's OAuth2LoginAuthenticationFilter only processes URLs matching
>
> /login/oauth2/code/\*. If you want to customize the redirect-uri to use a different pattern, you need to provide configuration to process that custom pattern. For example, for servlet applications, you can add your own SecurityFilterChain that resembles the following:

##### TIP

> Spring Boot auto-configures an InMemoryOAuth2AuthorizedClientService which is used by Spring Security for the management of client registrations. The InMemoryOAuth2AuthorizedClientService has limited capabilities and we recommend using it only for development environments. For production environments, consider using a JdbcOAuth2AuthorizedClientService or creating your own implementation of OAuth2AuthorizedClientService.
>
> **OAuth2 client registration for common providers**
>
> For common OAuth2 and OpenID providers, including Google, Github, Facebook, and Okta, we provide a set of provider defaults (google, github, facebook, and okta, respectively).
>
> If you do not need to customize these providers, you can set the provider attribute to the one for which you need to infer defaults. Also, if the key for the client registration matches a default supported provider, Spring Boot infers that as well.
>
> In other words, the two configurations in the following example use the Google provider:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### Resource Server

> If you have spring-security-oauth2-resource-server on your classpath, Spring Boot can set up an OAuth2 Resource Server. For JWT configuration, a JWK Set URI or OIDC Issuer URI needs to be specified, as shown in the following examples:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### NOTE

> If the authorization server does not support a JWK Set URI, you can configure the resource server with the Public Key used for verifying the signature of the JWT. This can be done using the spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.public-key- location property, where the value needs to point to a file containing the public key in the PEM-encoded x509 format.
>
> The same properties are applicable for both servlet and reactive applications.
>
> Alternatively, you can define your own JwtDecoder bean for servlet applications or a
>
> ReactiveJwtDecoder for reactive applications.
>
> In cases where opaque tokens are used instead of JWTs, you can configure the following properties to validate tokens via introspection:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> Again, the same properties are applicable for both servlet and reactive applications.
>
> Alternatively, you can define your own OpaqueTokenIntrospector bean for servlet applications or a
>
> ReactiveOpaqueTokenIntrospector for reactive applications.

##### Authorization Server

> Currently, Spring Security does not provide support for implementing an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server. However, this functionality is available from the Spring Security OAuth project, which will eventually be superseded by Spring Security completely. Until then, you can use the spring- security-oauth2-autoconfigure module to easily set up an OAuth 2.0 authorization server; see its documentation for instructions.

### SAML 2.0

##### Relying Party

> If you have spring-security-saml2-service-provider on your classpath, you can take advantage of some auto-configuration to set up a SAML 2.0 Relying Party. This configuration makes use of the properties under Saml2RelyingPartyProperties.
>
> A relying party registration represents a paired configuration between an Identity Provider, IDP, and a Service Provider, SP. You can register multiple relying parties under the spring.security.saml2.relyingparty prefix, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> spring.security.saml2.relyingparty.registration.my-relying- party1.signing.credentials\[0\].private-key-location=path-to-private-key spring.security.saml2.relyingparty.registration.my-relying- party1.signing.credentials\[0\].certificate-location=path-to-certificate spring.security.saml2.relyingparty.registration.my-relying- party1.decryption.credentials\[0\].private-key-location=path-to-private-key spring.security.saml2.relyingparty.registration.my-relying- party1.decryption.credentials\[0\].certificate-location=path-to-certificate spring.security.saml2.relyingparty.registration.my-relying- party1.identityprovider.verification.credentials\[0\].certificate-location=path-to- verification-cert

1.  **Actuator Security**

> For security purposes, all actuators other than /health are disabled by default. The
>
> management.endpoints.web.exposure.include property can be used to enable the actuators.
>
> If Spring Security is on the classpath and no other WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter or SecurityFilterChain bean is present, all actuators other than /health are secured by Spring Boot auto-configuration. If you define a custom WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter or SecurityFilterChain bean, Spring Boot auto-configuration will back off and you will be in full control of actuator access rules.

##### NOTE

> Before setting the management.endpoints.web.exposure.include, ensure that the exposed actuators do not contain sensitive information and/or are secured by placing them behind a firewall or by something like Spring Security.

##### Cross Site Request Forgery Protection

> Since Spring Boot relies on Spring Security's defaults, CSRF protection is turned on by default. This means that the actuator endpoints that require a POST (shutdown and loggers endpoints), PUT or DELETE will get a 403 forbidden error when the default security configuration is in use.
>
> **NOTE** We recommend disabling CSRF protection completely only if you are creating a service that is used by non-browser clients.
>
> Additional information about CSRF protection can be found in the Spring Security Reference Guide.

## Working with SQL Databases

> The Spring Framework provides extensive support for working with SQL databases, from direct JDBC access using JdbcTemplate to complete "object relational mapping" technologies such as Hibernate. Spring Data provides an additional level of functionality: creating Repository implementations directly from interfaces and using conventions to generate queries from your method names.

### Configure a DataSource

> Java's javax.sql.DataSource interface provides a standard method of working with database connections. Traditionally, a \'DataSource\' uses a URL along with some credentials to establish a database connection.
>
> **TIP** See [the "How-to" section](\l) for more advanced examples, typically to take full control over the configuration of the DataSource.

##### Embedded Database Support

> It is often convenient to develop applications by using an in-memory embedded database. Obviously, in-memory databases do not provide persistent storage. You need to populate your database when your application starts and be prepared to throw away data when your application ends.
>
> **TIP** The "How-to" section includes a [section on how to initialize a database](\l).
>
> Spring Boot can auto-configure embedded H2, HSQL, and Derby databases. You need not provide any connection URLs. You need only include a build dependency to the embedded database that you want to use. If there are multiple embedded databases on the classpath, set the spring.datasource.embedded-database-connection configuration property to control which one is used. Setting the property to none disables auto-configuration of an embedded database.

##### NOTE

> If you are using this feature in your tests, you may notice that the same database is reused by your whole test suite regardless of the number of application contexts that you use. If you want to make sure that each context has a separate embedded database, you should set spring.datasource.generate-unique-name to true.
>
> For example, the typical POM dependencies would be as follows:

##### NOTE

> You need a dependency on spring-jdbc for an embedded database to be auto- configured. In this example, it is pulled in transitively through spring-boot-starter- data-jpa.

##### TIP

> If, for whatever reason, you do configure the connection URL for an embedded database, take care to ensure that the database's automatic shutdown is disabled. If you use H2, you should use DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE to do so. If you use HSQLDB, you should ensure that shutdown=true is not used. Disabling the database's automatic shutdown lets Spring Boot control when the database is closed, thereby ensuring that it happens once access to the database is no longer needed.

##### Connection to a Production Database

> Production database connections can also be auto-configured by using a pooling DataSource.

##### DataSource Configuration

> DataSource configuration is controlled by external configuration properties in spring.datasource.\*. For example, you might declare the following section in application.properties:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### NOTE

> You should at least specify the URL by setting the spring.datasource.url property. Otherwise, Spring Boot tries to auto-configure an embedded database.

##### TIP

> Spring Boot can deduce the JDBC driver class for most databases from the URL. If you need to specify a specific class, you can use the spring.datasource.driver-class-name property.

##### NOTE

> For a pooling DataSource to be created, we need to be able to verify that a valid Driver class is available, so we check for that before doing anything. In other words, if you set spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver, then that class has to be loadable.
>
> See DataSourceProperties for more of the supported options. These are the standard options that work regardless of [the actual implementation](\l). It is also possible to fine-tune implementation- specific settings by using their respective prefix (spring.datasource.hikari.\*, spring.datasource.tomcat.\*, spring.datasource.dbcp2.\*, and spring.datasource.oracleucp.\*). Refer to the documentation of the connection pool implementation you are using for more details.
>
> For instance, if you use the Tomcat connection pool, you could customize many additional settings, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> This will set the pool to wait 10000ms before throwing an exception if no connection is available, limit the maximum number of connections to 50 and validate the connection before borrowing it from the pool.

##### Supported Connection Pools

> Spring Boot uses the following algorithm for choosing a specific implementation:

1.  We prefer HikariCP for its performance and concurrency. If HikariCP is available, we always choose it.

2.  Otherwise, if the Tomcat pooling DataSource is available, we use it.

3.  Otherwise, if Commons DBCP2 is available, we use it.

4.  If none of HikariCP, Tomcat, and DBCP2 are available and if Oracle UCP is available, we use it.

> **NOTE** If you use the spring-boot-starter-jdbc or spring-boot-starter-data-jpa "starters", you automatically get a dependency to HikariCP.
>
> You can bypass that algorithm completely and specify the connection pool to use by setting the spring.datasource.type property. This is especially important if you run your application in a Tomcat container, as tomcat-jdbc is provided by default.
>
> Additional connection pools can always be configured manually, using DataSourceBuilder. If you define your own DataSource bean, auto-configuration does not occur. The following connection pools are supported by DataSourceBuilder:

-   HikariCP

-   Tomcat pooling Datasource

-   Commons DBCP2

-   Oracle UCP & OracleDataSource

-   Spring Framework's SimpleDriverDataSource

-   H2 JdbcDataSource

-   PostgreSQL PGSimpleDataSource

##### Connection to a JNDI DataSource

> If you deploy your Spring Boot application to an Application Server, you might want to configure and manage your DataSource by using your Application Server's built-in features and access it by using JNDI.
>
> The spring.datasource.jndi-name property can be used as an alternative to the spring.datasource.url, spring.datasource.username, and spring.datasource.password properties to access the DataSource from a specific JNDI location. For example, the following section in application.properties shows how you can access a JBoss AS defined DataSource:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

### Using JdbcTemplate

> Spring's JdbcTemplate and NamedParameterJdbcTemplate classes are auto-configured, and you can
>
> \@Autowire them directly into your own beans, as shown in the following example:
>
> You can customize some properties of the template by using the spring.jdbc.template.\* properties, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### NOTE

> The NamedParameterJdbcTemplate reuses the same JdbcTemplate instance behind the scenes. If more than one JdbcTemplate is defined and no primary candidate exists, the NamedParameterJdbcTemplate is not auto-configured.

### JPA and Spring Data JPA

> The Java Persistence API is a standard technology that lets you "map" objects to relational databases. The spring-boot-starter-data-jpa POM provides a quick way to get started. It provides the following key dependencies:

-   Hibernate: One of the most popular JPA implementations.

-   Spring Data JPA: Helps you to implement JPA-based repositories.

-   Spring ORM: Core ORM support from the Spring Framework.

##### TIP

> We do not go into too many details of JPA or Spring Data here. You can follow the "Accessing Data with JPA" guide from spring.io and read the Spring Data JPA and Hibernate reference documentation.

##### Entity Classes

> Traditionally, JPA "Entity" classes are specified in a persistence.xml file. With Spring Boot, this file is not necessary and "Entity Scanning" is used instead. By default, all packages below your main configuration class (the one annotated with \@EnableAutoConfiguration or \@SpringBootApplication) are searched.
>
> Any classes annotated with \@Entity, \@Embeddable, or \@MappedSuperclass are considered. A typical entity class resembles the following example:
>
> import java.io.Serializable;
>
> import javax.persistence.Column; import javax.persistence.Entity;
>
> import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue; import javax.persistence.Id;
>
> \@Entity
>
> public class City implements Serializable {
>
> \@Id \@GeneratedValue private Long id;
>
> \@Column(nullable = false) private String name;
>
> \@Column(nullable = false) private String state;
>
> // \... additional members, often include \@OneToMany mappings protected City() {
>
> // no-args constructor required by JPA spec
>
> // this one is protected since it shouldn\'t be used directly
>
> }
>
> public City(String name, String state) { this.name = name;
>
> this.state = state;
>
> }
>
> public String getName() { return this.name;
>
> }
>
> public String getState() { return this.state;
>
> }
>
> // \... etc
>
> }

##### TIP

> You can customize entity scanning locations by using the \@EntityScan annotation. See the "[Separate \@Entity Definitions from Spring Configuration](\l)" how-to.

##### Spring Data JPA Repositories

> Spring Data JPA repositories are interfaces that you can define to access data. JPA queries are created automatically from your method names. For example, a CityRepository interface might declare a findAllByState(String state) method to find all the cities in a given state.
>
> For more complex queries, you can annotate your method with Spring Data's Query annotation.
>
> Spring Data repositories usually extend from the Repository or CrudRepository interfaces. If you use auto-configuration, repositories are searched from the package containing your main configuration class (the one annotated with \@EnableAutoConfiguration or \@SpringBootApplication) down.
>
> The following example shows a typical Spring Data repository interface definition:
>
> Spring Data JPA repositories support three different modes of bootstrapping: default, deferred, and lazy. To enable deferred or lazy bootstrapping, set the spring.data.jpa.repositories.bootstrap-mode property to deferred or lazy respectively. When using deferred or lazy bootstrapping, the auto- configured EntityManagerFactoryBuilder will use the context's AsyncTaskExecutor, if any, as the bootstrap executor. If more than one exists, the one named applicationTaskExecutor will be used.

##### NOTE

> When using deferred or lazy bootstrapping, make sure to defer any access to the JPA infrastructure after the application context bootstrap phase. You can use SmartInitializingSingleton to invoke any initialization that requires the JPA infrastructure. For JPA components (such as converters) that are created as Spring beans, use ObjectProvider to delay the resolution of dependencies, if any.

##### TIP

> We have barely scratched the surface of Spring Data JPA. For complete details, see the Spring Data JPA reference documentation.

##### Creating and Dropping JPA Databases

> By default, JPA databases are automatically created **only** if you use an embedded database (H2, HSQL, or Derby). You can explicitly configure JPA settings by using spring.jpa.\* properties. For example, to create and drop tables you can add the following line to your application.properties:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### NOTE

> Hibernate's own internal property name for this (if you happen to remember it better) is hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto. You can set it, along with other Hibernate native properties, by using spring.jpa.properties.\* (the prefix is stripped before adding them to the entity manager). The following line shows an example of setting JPA properties for Hibernate:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> The line in the preceding example passes a value of true for the
>
> hibernate.globally_quoted_identifiers property to the Hibernate entity manager.
>
> By default, the DDL execution (or validation) is deferred until the ApplicationContext has started. There is also a spring.jpa.generate-ddl flag, but it is not used if Hibernate auto-configuration is active, because the ddl-auto settings are more fine-grained.

##### Open EntityManager in View

> If you are running a web application, Spring Boot by default registers OpenEntityManagerInViewInterceptor to apply the "Open EntityManager in View" pattern, to allow for lazy loading in web views. If you do not want this behavior, you should set spring.jpa.open-in- view to false in your application.properties.

### Spring Data JDBC

> Spring Data includes repository support for JDBC and will automatically generate SQL for the methods on CrudRepository. For more advanced queries, a \@Query annotation is provided.
>
> Spring Boot will auto-configure Spring Data's JDBC repositories when the necessary dependencies are on the classpath. They can be added to your project with a single dependency on spring-boot- starter-data-jdbc. If necessary, you can take control of Spring Data JDBC's configuration by adding the \@EnableJdbcRepositories annotation or a JdbcConfiguration subclass to your application.
>
> **TIP** For complete details of Spring Data JDBC, please refer to the reference documentation.

### Using H2's Web Console

> The H2 database provides a browser-based console that Spring Boot can auto-configure for you. The console is auto-configured when the following conditions are met:

-   You are developing a servlet-based web application.

-   com.h2database:h2 is on the classpath.

-   You are using [Spring Boot's developer tools](\l).

##### TIP

> If you are not using Spring Boot's developer tools but would still like to make use of H2's console, you can configure the spring.h2.console.enabled property with a value of true.

##### NOTE

> The H2 console is only intended for use during development, so you should take care to ensure that spring.h2.console.enabled is not set to true in production.

##### Changing the H2 Console's Path

> By default, the console is available at /h2-console. You can customize the console's path by using the
>
> spring.h2.console.path property.

### Using jOOQ

> jOOQ Object Oriented Querying (jOOQ) is a popular product from Data Geekery which generates Java code from your database and lets you build type-safe SQL queries through its fluent API. Both the commercial and open source editions can be used with Spring Boot.

##### Code Generation

> In order to use jOOQ type-safe queries, you need to generate Java classes from your database schema. You can follow the instructions in the jOOQ user manual. If you use the jooq-codegen-maven plugin and you also use the spring-boot-starter-parent "parent POM", you can safely omit the plugin's \<version> tag. You can also use Spring Boot-defined version variables (such as h2.version) to declare the plugin's database dependency. The following listing shows an example:

##### Using DSLContext

> The fluent API offered by jOOQ is initiated through the org.jooq.DSLContext interface. Spring Boot auto-configures a DSLContext as a Spring Bean and connects it to your application DataSource. To use the DSLContext, you can inject it, as shown in the following example:
>
> **TIP** The jOOQ manual tends to use a variable named create to hold the DSLContext.
>
> You can then use the DSLContext to construct your queries, as shown in the following example:

##### jOOQ SQL Dialect

> Unless the spring.jooq.sql-dialect property has been configured, Spring Boot determines the SQL dialect to use for your datasource. If Spring Boot could not detect the dialect, it uses DEFAULT.
>
> **NOTE** Spring Boot can only auto-configure dialects supported by the open source version of jOOQ.

##### Customizing jOOQ

> More advanced customizations can be achieved by defining your own DefaultConfigurationCustomizer bean that will be invoked prior to creating the org.jooq.Configuration \@Bean. This takes precedence to anything that is applied by the auto- configuration.
>
> You can also create your own org.jooq.Configuration \@Bean if you want to take complete control of the jOOQ configuration.

### Using R2DBC

> The Reactive Relational Database Connectivity (R2DBC) project brings reactive programming APIs to relational databases. R2DBC's io.r2dbc.spi.Connection provides a standard method of working with non-blocking database connections. Connections are provided via a ConnectionFactory, similar to a DataSource with jdbc.
>
> ConnectionFactory configuration is controlled by external configuration properties in
>
> spring.r2dbc.\*. For example, you might declare the following section in application.properties:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### TIP

> You do not need to specify a driver class name, since Spring Boot obtains the driver from R2DBC's Connection Factory discovery.

##### NOTE

> At least the url should be provided. Information specified in the URL takes precedence over individual properties, i.e. name, username, password and pooling options.
>
> **TIP** The "How-to" section includes a [section on how to initialize a database](\l).
>
> To customize the connections created by a ConnectionFactory, i.e., set specific parameters that you do not want (or cannot) configure in your central database configuration, you can use a ConnectionFactoryOptionsBuilderCustomizer \@Bean. The following example shows how to manually override the database port while the rest of the options is taken from the application configuration:
>
> The following examples show how to set some PostgreSQL connection options:
>
> When a ConnectionFactory bean is available, the regular JDBC DataSource auto-configuration backs off. If you want to retain the JDBC DataSource auto-configuration, and are comfortable with the risk
>
> of using the blocking JDBC API in a reactive application, add \@Import(DataSourceAutoConfiguration.class) on a \@Configuration class in your application to re- enable it.

##### Embedded Database Support

> Similarly to [the JDBC support](\l), Spring Boot can automatically configure an embedded database for reactive usage. You need not provide any connection URLs. You need only include a build dependency to the embedded database that you want to use, as shown in the following example:

##### NOTE

> If you are using this feature in your tests, you may notice that the same database is reused by your whole test suite regardless of the number of application contexts that you use. If you want to make sure that each context has a separate embedded database, you should set spring.r2dbc.generate-unique-name to true.

##### Using DatabaseClient

> A DatabaseClient bean is auto-configured, and you can \@Autowire it directly into your own beans, as shown in the following example:

##### Spring Data R2DBC Repositories

> Spring Data R2DBC repositories are interfaces that you can define to access data. Queries are created automatically from your method names. For example, a CityRepository interface might declare a findAllByState(String state) method to find all the cities in a given state.
>
> For more complex queries, you can annotate your method with Spring Data's Query annotation.
>
> Spring Data repositories usually extend from the Repository or CrudRepository interfaces. If you use auto-configuration, repositories are searched from the package containing your main configuration class (the one annotated with \@EnableAutoConfiguration or \@SpringBootApplication) down.
>
> The following example shows a typical Spring Data repository interface definition:

##### TIP

> We have barely scratched the surface of Spring Data R2DBC. For complete details, see the Spring Data R2DBC reference documentation.

## Working with NoSQL Technologies

> Spring Data provides additional projects that help you access a variety of NoSQL technologies, including:

-   MongoDB

-   Neo4J

-   Elasticsearch

-   Redis

-   GemFire or Geode

-   Cassandra

-   Couchbase

-   LDAP

> Spring Boot provides auto-configuration for Redis, MongoDB, Neo4j, Solr, Elasticsearch, Cassandra, Couchbase, LDAP and InfluxDB. You can make use of the other projects, but you must configure them yourself. Refer to the appropriate reference documentation at spring.io/projects/spring-data.

### Redis

> Redis is a cache, message broker, and richly-featured key-value store. Spring Boot offers basic auto- configuration for the Lettuce and Jedis client libraries and the abstractions on top of them provided by Spring Data Redis.
>
> There is a spring-boot-starter-data-redis "Starter" for collecting the dependencies in a convenient way. By default, it uses Lettuce. That starter handles both traditional and reactive applications.
>
> **TIP** We also provide a spring-boot-starter-data-redis-reactive "Starter" for consistency with the other stores with reactive support.

##### Connecting to Redis

> You can inject an auto-configured RedisConnectionFactory, StringRedisTemplate, or vanilla RedisTemplate instance as you would any other Spring Bean. By default, the instance tries to connect to a Redis server at localhost:6379. The following listing shows an example of such a bean:

##### TIP

> You can also register an arbitrary number of beans that implement LettuceClientConfigurationBuilderCustomizer for more advanced customizations. If you use Jedis, JedisClientConfigurationBuilderCustomizer is also available.
>
> If you add your own \@Bean of any of the auto-configured types, it replaces the default (except in the case of RedisTemplate, when the exclusion is based on the bean name, redisTemplate, not its type).
>
> A pooled connection factory is auto-configured if commons-pool2 is on the classpath and at least one
>
> Pool option of RedisProperties is set.

### MongoDB

> MongoDB is an open-source NoSQL document database that uses a JSON-like schema instead of traditional table-based relational data. Spring Boot offers several conveniences for working with MongoDB, including the spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb and spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb- reactive "Starters".

##### Connecting to a MongoDB Database

> To access MongoDB databases, you can inject an auto-configured org.springframework.data.mongodb.MongoDatabaseFactory. By default, the instance tries to connect to a MongoDB server at mongodb://localhost/test. The following example shows how to connect to a MongoDB database:
>
> If you have defined your own MongoClient, it will be used to auto-configure a suitable
>
> MongoDatabaseFactory.
>
> The auto-configured MongoClient is created using a MongoClientSettings bean. If you have defined your own MongoClientSettings, it will be used without modification and the spring.data.mongodb properties will be ignored. Otherwise a MongoClientSettings will be auto-configured and will have the spring.data.mongodb properties applied to it. In either case, you can declare one or more MongoClientSettingsBuilderCustomizer beans to fine-tune the MongoClientSettings configuration. Each will be called in order with the MongoClientSettings.Builder that is used to build the MongoClientSettings.
>
> You can set the spring.data.mongodb.uri property to change the URL and configure additional
>
> settings such as the *replica set*, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> Alternatively, you can specify connection details using discrete properties. For example, you might declare the following settings in your application.properties:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### TIP

> If spring.data.mongodb.port is not specified, the default of 27017 is used. You could delete this line from the example shown earlier.

##### TIP

> If you do not use Spring Data MongoDB, you can inject a MongoClient bean instead of using MongoDatabaseFactory. If you want to take complete control of establishing the MongoDB connection, you can also declare your own MongoDatabaseFactory or MongoClient bean.

##### NOTE

> If you are using the reactive driver, Netty is required for SSL. The auto- configuration configures this factory automatically if Netty is available and the factory to use hasn't been customized already.

##### MongoTemplate

> Spring Data MongoDB provides a MongoTemplate class that is very similar in its design to Spring's JdbcTemplate. As with JdbcTemplate, Spring Boot auto-configures a bean for you to inject the template, as follows:
>
> See the MongoOperations Javadoc for complete details.

##### Spring Data MongoDB Repositories

> Spring Data includes repository support for MongoDB. As with the JPA repositories discussed earlier, the basic principle is that queries are constructed automatically, based on method names.
>
> In fact, both Spring Data JPA and Spring Data MongoDB share the same common infrastructure. You could take the JPA example from earlier and, assuming that City is now a MongoDB data class rather than a JPA \@Entity, it works in the same way, as shown in the following example:

##### TIP

> **TIP**
>
> You can customize document scanning locations by using the \@EntityScan annotation.
>
> For complete details of Spring Data MongoDB, including its rich object mapping technologies, refer to its reference documentation.

##### Embedded Mongo

> Spring Boot offers auto-configuration for Embedded Mongo. To use it in your Spring Boot application, add a dependency on de.flapdoodle.embed:de.flapdoodle.embed.mongo.
>
> The port that Mongo listens on can be configured by setting the spring.data.mongodb.port property. To use a randomly allocated free port, use a value of 0. The MongoClient created by MongoAutoConfiguration is automatically configured to use the randomly allocated port.
>
> **NOTE** If you do not configure a custom port, the embedded support uses a random port (rather than 27017) by default.
>
> If you have SLF4J on the classpath, the output produced by Mongo is automatically routed to a logger named org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.mongo.embedded.EmbeddedMongo.
>
> You can declare your own IMongodConfig and IRuntimeConfig beans to take control of the Mongo instance's configuration and logging routing. The download configuration can be customized by declaring a DownloadConfigBuilderCustomizer bean.

### Neo4j

> Neo4j is an open-source NoSQL graph database that uses a rich data model of nodes connected by first class relationships, which is better suited for connected big data than traditional RDBMS approaches. Spring Boot offers several conveniences for working with Neo4j, including the spring- boot-starter-data-neo4j "Starter".

##### Connecting to a Neo4j Database

> To access a Neo4j server, you can inject an auto-configured org.neo4j.driver.Driver. By default, the instance tries to connect to a Neo4j server at localhost:7687 using the Bolt protocol. The following example shows how to inject a Neo4j Driver that gives you access, amongst other things, to a
>
> Session:
>
> You can configure various aspects of the driver using spring.neo4j.\* properties. The following example shows how to configure the uri and credentials to use:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> The auto-configured Driver is created using ConfigBuilder. To fine-tune its configuration, declare one or more ConfigBuilderCustomizer beans. Each will be called in order with the ConfigBuilder that
>
> is used to build the Driver.

##### Spring Data Neo4j Repositories

> Spring Data includes repository support for Neo4j. For complete details of Spring Data Neo4j, refer to the reference documentation.
>
> Spring Data Neo4j shares the common infrastructure with Spring Data JPA as many other Spring Data modules do. You could take the JPA example from earlier and define City as Spring Data Neo4j \@Node rather than JPA \@Entity and the repository abstraction works in the same way, as shown in the following example:
>
> The spring-boot-starter-data-neo4j "Starter" enables the repository support as well as transaction management. Spring Boot supports both classic and reactive Neo4j repositories, using the Neo4jTemplate or ReactiveNeo4jTemplate beans. When Project Reactor is available on the classpath, the reactive style is also auto-configured.
>
> You can customize the locations to look for repositories and entities by using
>
> \@EnableNeo4jRepositories and \@EntityScan respectively on a \@Configuration-bean.
>
> In an application using the reactive style, a ReactiveTransactionManager is not auto- configured. To enable transaction management, the following bean must be defined in your configuration:

##### NOTE

4.  **Solr**

> Apache Solr is a search engine. Spring Boot offers basic auto-configuration for the Solr 5 client library.

##### Connecting to Solr

> You can inject an auto-configured SolrClient instance as you would any other Spring bean. By default, the instance tries to connect to a server at localhost:8983/solr. The following example shows how to inject a Solr bean:
>
> If you add your own \@Bean of type SolrClient, it replaces the default.

### Elasticsearch

> Elasticsearch is an open source, distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine. Spring Boot offers basic auto-configuration for Elasticsearch.
>
> Spring Boot supports several clients:

-   The official Java \"Low Level\" and \"High Level\" REST clients

-   The ReactiveElasticsearchClient provided by Spring Data Elasticsearch

> Spring Boot provides a dedicated "Starter", spring-boot-starter-data-elasticsearch.

##### Connecting to Elasticsearch using REST clients

> Elasticsearch ships two different REST clients that you can use to query a cluster: the \"Low Level\" client and the \"High Level\" client. Spring Boot provides support for the \"High Level\" client, which ships with org.elasticsearch.client:elasticsearch-rest-high-level-client.
>
> If you have this dependency on the classpath, Spring Boot will auto-configure and register a RestHighLevelClient bean that by default targets localhost:9200. You can further tune how RestHighLevelClient is configured, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> You can also register an arbitrary number of beans that implement RestClientBuilderCustomizer for more advanced customizations. To take full control over the registration, define a RestClientBuilder bean.
>
> **TIP** If your application needs access to a \"Low Level\" RestClient, you can get it by calling
>
> client.getLowLevelClient() on the auto-configured RestHighLevelClient.
>
> Additionally, if elasticsearch-rest-client-sniffer is on the classpath, a Sniffer is auto-configured to automatically discover nodes from a running Elasticsearch cluster and set them to the RestHighLevelClient bean. You can further tune how Sniffer is configured, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### Connecting to Elasticsearch using Reactive REST clients

> Spring Data Elasticsearch ships ReactiveElasticsearchClient for querying Elasticsearch instances in a reactive fashion. It is built on top of WebFlux's WebClient, so both spring-boot-starter- elasticsearch and spring-boot-starter-webflux dependencies are useful to enable this support.
>
> By default, Spring Boot will auto-configure and register a ReactiveElasticsearchClient bean that targets localhost:9200. You can further tune how it is configured, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> If the configuration properties are not enough and you'd like to fully control the client configuration, you can register a custom ClientConfiguration bean.

##### Connecting to Elasticsearch by Using Spring Data

> To connect to Elasticsearch, a RestHighLevelClient bean must be defined, auto-configured by Spring Boot or manually provided by the application (see previous sections). With this configuration in place, an ElasticsearchRestTemplate can be injected like any other Spring bean, as shown in the following example:
>
> In the presence of spring-data-elasticsearch and the required dependencies for using a WebClient (typically spring-boot-starter-webflux), Spring Boot can also auto-configure a [ReactiveElasticsearchClient](\l) and a ReactiveElasticsearchTemplate as beans. They are the reactive equivalent of the other REST clients.

##### Spring Data Elasticsearch Repositories

> Spring Data includes repository support for Elasticsearch. As with the JPA repositories discussed earlier, the basic principle is that queries are constructed for you automatically based on method names.
>
> In fact, both Spring Data JPA and Spring Data Elasticsearch share the same common infrastructure. You could take the JPA example from earlier and, assuming that City is now an Elasticsearch \@Document class rather than a JPA \@Entity, it works in the same way.
>
> **TIP** For complete details of Spring Data Elasticsearch, refer to the reference documentation.
>
> Spring Boot supports both classic and reactive Elasticsearch repositories, using the ElasticsearchRestTemplate or ReactiveElasticsearchTemplate beans. Most likely those beans are auto-configured by Spring Boot given the required dependencies are present.
>
> If you wish to use your own template for backing the Elasticsearch repositories, you can add your own ElasticsearchRestTemplate or ElasticsearchOperations \@Bean, as long as it is named \"elasticsearchTemplate\". Same applies to ReactiveElasticsearchTemplate and ReactiveElasticsearchOperations, with the bean name \"reactiveElasticsearchTemplate\".
>
> You can choose to disable the repositories support with the following property:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

### Cassandra

> Cassandra is an open source, distributed database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers. Spring Boot offers auto-configuration for Cassandra and the abstractions on top of it provided by Spring Data Cassandra. There is a spring- boot-starter-data-cassandra "Starter" for collecting the dependencies in a convenient way.

##### Connecting to Cassandra

> You can inject an auto-configured CassandraTemplate or a Cassandra CqlSession instance as you would with any other Spring Bean. The spring.data.cassandra.\* properties can be used to customize the connection. Generally, you provide keyspace-name and contact-points as well the local datacenter name, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> If the port is the same for all your contact points you can use a shortcut and only specify the host names, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### TIP

> Those two examples are identical as the port default to 9042. If you need to configure the port, use spring.data.cassandra.port.

##### NOTE

> **NOTE**
>
> The Cassandra driver has its own configuration infrastructure that loads an
>
> application.conf at the root of the classpath.
>
> Spring Boot does not look for such a file by default but can load one using spring.data.cassandra.config. If a property is both present in spring.data.cassandra.\* and the configuration file, the value in spring.data.cassandra.\* takes precedence.
>
> For more advanced driver customizations, you can register an arbitrary number of beans that implement DriverConfigLoaderBuilderCustomizer. The CqlSession can be customized with a bean of type CqlSessionBuilderCustomizer.
>
> If you're using CqlSessionBuilder to create multiple CqlSession beans, keep in mind the builder is mutable so make sure to inject a fresh copy for each session.
>
> The following code listing shows how to inject a Cassandra bean:
>
> If you add your own \@Bean of type CassandraTemplate, it replaces the default.

##### Spring Data Cassandra Repositories

> Spring Data includes basic repository support for Cassandra. Currently, this is more limited than the JPA repositories discussed earlier and needs to annotate finder methods with \@Query.
>
> **TIP** For complete details of Spring Data Cassandra, refer to the reference documentation.

### Couchbase

> Couchbase is an open-source, distributed, multi-model NoSQL document-oriented database that is optimized for interactive applications. Spring Boot offers auto-configuration for Couchbase and the abstractions on top of it provided by Spring Data Couchbase. There are spring-boot-starter-data- couchbase and spring-boot-starter-data-couchbase-reactive "Starters" for collecting the dependencies in a convenient way.

##### Connecting to Couchbase

> You can get a Cluster by adding the Couchbase SDK and some configuration. The spring.couchbase.\* properties can be used to customize the connection. Generally, you provide the connection string, username, and password, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> It is also possible to customize some of the ClusterEnvironment settings. For instance, the following configuration changes the timeout to use to open a new Bucket and enables SSL support:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### TIP

> Check the spring.couchbase.env.\* properties for more details. To take more control, one or more ClusterEnvironmentBuilderCustomizer beans can be used.

##### Spring Data Couchbase Repositories

> Spring Data includes repository support for Couchbase. For complete details of Spring Data Couchbase, refer to the reference documentation.
>
> You can inject an auto-configured CouchbaseTemplate instance as you would with any other Spring Bean, provided a CouchbaseClientFactory bean is available. This happens when a Cluster is available, as described above, and a bucket name has been specified:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> The following examples shows how to inject a CouchbaseTemplate bean:
>
> There are a few beans that you can define in your own configuration to override those provided by the auto-configuration:

-   A CouchbaseMappingContext \@Bean with a name of couchbaseMappingContext.

-   A CustomConversions \@Bean with a name of couchbaseCustomConversions.

-   A CouchbaseTemplate \@Bean with a name of couchbaseTemplate.

> To avoid hard-coding those names in your own config, you can reuse BeanNames provided by Spring Data Couchbase. For instance, you can customize the converters to use, as follows:

### LDAP

> LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is an open, vendor-neutral, industry standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an IP network. Spring Boot offers auto-configuration for any compliant LDAP server as well as support for the embedded in-memory LDAP server from UnboundID.
>
> LDAP abstractions are provided by Spring Data LDAP. There is a spring-boot-starter-data-ldap
>
> "Starter" for collecting the dependencies in a convenient way.

##### Connecting to an LDAP Server

> To connect to an LDAP server, make sure you declare a dependency on the spring-boot-starter- data-ldap "Starter" or spring-ldap-core and then declare the URLs of your server in your application.properties, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> If you need to customize connection settings, you can use the spring.ldap.base and
>
> spring.ldap.base-environment properties.
>
> An LdapContextSource is auto-configured based on these settings. If a DirContextAuthenticationStrategy bean is available, it is associated to the auto-configured LdapContextSource. If you need to customize it, for instance to use a PooledContextSource, you can still inject the auto-configured LdapContextSource. Make sure to flag your customized ContextSource as \@Primary so that the auto-configured LdapTemplate uses it.

##### Spring Data LDAP Repositories

> Spring Data includes repository support for LDAP. For complete details of Spring Data LDAP, refer to the reference documentation.
>
> You can also inject an auto-configured LdapTemplate instance as you would with any other Spring Bean, as shown in the following example:

##### Embedded In-memory LDAP Server

> For testing purposes, Spring Boot supports auto-configuration of an in-memory LDAP server from UnboundID. To configure the server, add a dependency to com.unboundid:unboundid-ldapsdk and declare a spring.ldap.embedded.base-dn property, as follows:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### NOTE

> It is possible to define multiple base-dn values, however, since distinguished names usually contain commas, they must be defined using the correct notation.
>
> In yaml files, you can use the yaml list notation. In properties files, you must include the index as part of the property name:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> By default, the server starts on a random port and triggers the regular LDAP support. There is no need to specify a spring.ldap.urls property.
>
> If there is a schema.ldif file on your classpath, it is used to initialize the server. If you want to load the initialization script from a different resource, you can also use the spring.ldap.embedded.ldif property.
>
> By default, a standard schema is used to validate LDIF files. You can turn off validation altogether by setting the spring.ldap.embedded.validation.enabled property. If you have custom attributes, you can use spring.ldap.embedded.validation.schema to define your custom attribute types or object classes.

### InfluxDB

> InfluxDB is an open-source time series database optimized for fast, high-availability storage and retrieval of time series data in fields such as operations monitoring, application metrics, Internet- of-Things sensor data, and real-time analytics.

##### Connecting to InfluxDB

> Spring Boot auto-configures an InfluxDB instance, provided the influxdb-java client is on the classpath and the URL of the database is set, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> If the connection to InfluxDB requires a user and password, you can set the spring.influx.user and
>
> spring.influx.password properties accordingly.
>
> InfluxDB relies on OkHttp. If you need to tune the http client InfluxDB uses behind the scenes, you can register an InfluxDbOkHttpClientBuilderProvider bean.
>
> If you need more control over the configuration, consider registering an InfluxDbCustomizer bean.

## Caching

> The Spring Framework provides support for transparently adding caching to an application. At its core, the abstraction applies caching to methods, thus reducing the number of executions based on the information available in the cache. The caching logic is applied transparently, without any interference to the invoker. Spring Boot auto-configures the cache infrastructure as long as caching support is enabled via the \@EnableCaching annotation.
>
> **NOTE** Check the relevant section of the Spring Framework reference for more details.
>
> In a nutshell, to add caching to an operation of your service add the relevant annotation to its method, as shown in the following example:
>
> This example demonstrates the use of caching on a potentially costly operation. Before invoking computePiDecimal, the abstraction looks for an entry in the piDecimals cache that matches the i argument. If an entry is found, the content in the cache is immediately returned to the caller, and
>
> the method is not invoked. Otherwise, the method is invoked, and the cache is updated before returning the value.

##### CAUTION

> You can also use the standard JSR-107 (JCache) annotations (such as \@CacheResult) transparently. However, we strongly advise you to not mix and match the Spring Cache and JCache annotations.
>
> If you do not add any specific cache library, Spring Boot auto-configures a [simple provider](\l) that uses concurrent maps in memory. When a cache is required (such as piDecimals in the preceding example), this provider creates it for you. The simple provider is not really recommended for production usage, but it is great for getting started and making sure that you understand the features. When you have made up your mind about the cache provider to use, please make sure to read its documentation to figure out how to configure the caches that your application uses. Nearly all providers require you to explicitly configure every cache that you use in the application. Some offer a way to customize the default caches defined by the spring.cache.cache-names property.
>
> **TIP** It is also possible to transparently update or evict data from the cache.

1.  **Supported Cache Providers**

> The cache abstraction does not provide an actual store and relies on abstraction materialized by the
>
> org.springframework.cache.Cache and org.springframework.cache.CacheManager interfaces.
>
> If you have not defined a bean of type CacheManager or a CacheResolver named cacheResolver (see
>
> CachingConfigurer), Spring Boot tries to detect the following providers (in the indicated order):

1.  [Generic](\l)

2.  [JCache (JSR-107)](\l) (EhCache 3, Hazelcast, Infinispan, and others)

3.  [EhCache 2.x](\l)

4.  [Hazelcast](\l)

5.  [Infinispan](\l)

6.  [Couchbase](\l)

7.  [Redis](\l)

8.  [Caffeine](\l)

9.  [Simple](\l)

##### TIP

> It is also possible to *force* a particular cache provider by setting the spring.cache.type property. Use this property if you need to [disable caching altogether](\l) in certain environment (such as tests).

##### TIP

> Use the spring-boot-starter-cache "Starter" to quickly add basic caching dependencies. The starter brings in spring-context-support. If you add dependencies manually, you must include spring-context-support in order to use the JCache, EhCache 2.x, or Caffeine support.
>
> If the CacheManager is auto-configured by Spring Boot, you can further tune its configuration before it is fully initialized by exposing a bean that implements the CacheManagerCustomizer interface. The following example sets a flag to say that null values should be passed down to the underlying map:

##### NOTE

> In the preceding example, an auto-configured ConcurrentMapCacheManager is expected. If that is not the case (either you provided your own config or a different cache provider was auto-configured), the customizer is not invoked at all. You can have as many customizers as you want, and you can also order them by using \@Order or Ordered.

##### Generic

> Generic caching is used if the context defines *at least* one org.springframework.cache.Cache bean. A
>
> CacheManager wrapping all beans of that type is created.

##### JCache (JSR-107)

> JCache is bootstrapped through the presence of a javax.cache.spi.CachingProvider on the classpath (that is, a JSR-107 compliant caching library exists on the classpath), and the JCacheCacheManager is provided by the spring-boot-starter-cache "Starter". Various compliant libraries are available, and Spring Boot provides dependency management for Ehcache 3, Hazelcast, and Infinispan. Any other compliant library can be added as well.
>
> It might happen that more than one provider is present, in which case the provider must be explicitly specified. Even if the JSR-107 standard does not enforce a standardized way to define the location of the configuration file, Spring Boot does its best to accommodate setting a cache with implementation details, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### NOTE

> When a cache library offers both a native implementation and JSR-107 support, Spring Boot prefers the JSR-107 support, so that the same features are available if you switch to a different JSR-107 implementation.

##### TIP

> Spring Boot has [general support for Hazelcast](\l). If a single HazelcastInstance is available, it is automatically reused for the CacheManager as well, unless the spring.cache.jcache.config property is specified.
>
> There are two ways to customize the underlying javax.cache.cacheManager:

-   Caches can be created on startup by setting the spring.cache.cache-names property. If a custom

> javax.cache.configuration.Configuration bean is defined, it is used to customize them.

-   org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.cache.JCacheManagerCustomizer beans are invoked with the reference of the CacheManager for full customization.

##### TIP

> If a standard javax.cache.CacheManager bean is defined, it is wrapped automatically in an org.springframework.cache.CacheManager implementation that the abstraction expects. No further customization is applied to it.

##### EhCache 2.x

> EhCache 2.x is used if a file named ehcache.xml can be found at the root of the classpath. If EhCache

x.  is found, the EhCacheCacheManager provided by the spring-boot-starter-cache "Starter" is used to bootstrap the cache manager. An alternate configuration file can be provided as well, as shown in the following example:

> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### Hazelcast

> Spring Boot has [general support for Hazelcast](\l). If a HazelcastInstance has been auto-configured, it is automatically wrapped in a CacheManager.

##### Infinispan

> Infinispan has no default configuration file location, so it must be specified explicitly. Otherwise, the default bootstrap is used.
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> Caches can be created on startup by setting the spring.cache.cache-names property. If a custom
>
> ConfigurationBuilder bean is defined, it is used to customize the caches.

##### NOTE

> The support of Infinispan in Spring Boot is restricted to the embedded mode and is quite basic. If you want more options, you should use the official Infinispan Spring Boot starter instead. See Infinispan's documentation for more details.

##### Couchbase

> If Spring Data Couchbase is available and Couchbase is [configured](\l), a CouchbaseCacheManager is auto- configured. It is possible to create additional caches on startup by setting the spring.cache.cache- names property and cache defaults can be configured by using spring.cache.couchbase.\* properties. For instance, the following configuration creates cache1 and cache2 caches with an entry *expiration* of 10 minutes:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> If you need more control over the configuration, consider registering a CouchbaseCacheManagerBuilderCustomizer bean. The following example shows a customizer that configures a specific entry expiration for cache1 and cache2:
>
> import java.time.Duration;
>
> import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.cache.CouchbaseCacheManagerBuilderCustomizer; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
>
> import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
>
> import org.springframework.data.couchbase.cache.CouchbaseCacheConfiguration;
>
> \@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
>
> public class MyCouchbaseCacheManagerConfiguration {
>
> \@Bean
>
> public CouchbaseCacheManagerBuilderCustomizer myCouchbaseCacheManagerBuilderCustomizer() {
>
> return (builder) -\> builder
>
> .withCacheConfiguration(\"cache1\", CouchbaseCacheConfiguration
>
> .defaultCacheConfig().entryExpiry(Duration.ofSeconds(10)))
>
> .withCacheConfiguration(\"cache2\", CouchbaseCacheConfiguration
>
> .defaultCacheConfig().entryExpiry(Duration.ofMinutes(1)));
>
> }
>
> }

##### Redis

> If Redis is available and configured, a RedisCacheManager is auto-configured. It is possible to create additional caches on startup by setting the spring.cache.cache-names property and cache defaults can be configured by using spring.cache.redis.\* properties. For instance, the following configuration creates cache1 and cache2 caches with a *time to live* of 10 minutes:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### NOTE

> By default, a key prefix is added so that, if two separate caches use the same key, Redis does not have overlapping keys and cannot return invalid values. We strongly recommend keeping this setting enabled if you create your own RedisCacheManager.

##### TIP

> You can take full control of the default configuration by adding a RedisCacheConfiguration \@Bean of your own. This can be useful if you're looking for customizing the default serialization strategy.
>
> If you need more control over the configuration, consider registering a RedisCacheManagerBuilderCustomizer bean. The following example shows a customizer that configures a specific time to live for cache1 and cache2:

#### import java.time.Duration;

> import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.cache.RedisCacheManagerBuilderCustomizer; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
>
> import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
>
> import org.springframework.data.redis.cache.RedisCacheConfiguration;
>
> \@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
>
> public class MyRedisCacheManagerConfiguration {
>
> \@Bean
>
> public RedisCacheManagerBuilderCustomizer myRedisCacheManagerBuilderCustomizer() { return (builder) -\> builder
>
> .withCacheConfiguration(\"cache1\", RedisCacheConfiguration
>
> .defaultCacheConfig().entryTtl(Duration.ofSeconds(10)))
>
> .withCacheConfiguration(\"cache2\", RedisCacheConfiguration
>
> .defaultCacheConfig().entryTtl(Duration.ofMinutes(1)));
>
> }
>
> }

##### Caffeine

> Caffeine is a Java 8 rewrite of Guava's cache that supersedes support for Guava. If Caffeine is present, a CaffeineCacheManager (provided by the spring-boot-starter-cache "Starter") is auto- configured. Caches can be created on startup by setting the spring.cache.cache-names property and
>
> can be customized by one of the following (in the indicated order):

1.  A cache spec defined by spring.cache.caffeine.spec

2.  A com.github.benmanes.caffeine.cache.CaffeineSpec bean is defined

3.  A com.github.benmanes.caffeine.cache.Caffeine bean is defined

> For instance, the following configuration creates cache1 and cache2 caches with a maximum size of 500 and a *time to live* of 10 minutes
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> If a com.github.benmanes.caffeine.cache.CacheLoader bean is defined, it is automatically associated to the CaffeineCacheManager. Since the CacheLoader is going to be associated with *all* caches managed by the cache manager, it must be defined as CacheLoader\<Object, Object>. The auto-configuration ignores any other generic type.

##### Simple

> If none of the other providers can be found, a simple implementation using a ConcurrentHashMap as the cache store is configured. This is the default if no caching library is present in your application. By default, caches are created as needed, but you can restrict the list of available caches by setting the cache-names property. For instance, if you want only cache1 and cache2 caches, set the cache- names property as follows:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> If you do so and your application uses a cache not listed, then it fails at runtime when the cache is needed, but not on startup. This is similar to the way the \"real\" cache providers behave if you use
>
> an undeclared cache.

##### None

> When \@EnableCaching is present in your configuration, a suitable cache configuration is expected as well. If you need to disable caching altogether in certain environments, force the cache type to none to use a no-op implementation, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

## Messaging

> The Spring Framework provides extensive support for integrating with messaging systems, from simplified use of the JMS API using JmsTemplate to a complete infrastructure to receive messages asynchronously. Spring AMQP provides a similar feature set for the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol. Spring Boot also provides auto-configuration options for RabbitTemplate and RabbitMQ. Spring WebSocket natively includes support for STOMP messaging, and Spring Boot has support for that through starters and a small amount of auto-configuration. Spring Boot also has support for Apache Kafka.

### JMS

> The javax.jms.ConnectionFactory interface provides a standard method of creating a javax.jms.Connection for interacting with a JMS broker. Although Spring needs a ConnectionFactory to work with JMS, you generally need not use it directly yourself and can instead rely on higher level messaging abstractions. (See the relevant section of the Spring Framework reference documentation for details.) Spring Boot also auto-configures the necessary infrastructure to send and receive messages.

##### ActiveMQ Support

> When ActiveMQ is available on the classpath, Spring Boot can also configure a ConnectionFactory. If the broker is present, an embedded broker is automatically started and configured (provided no broker URL is specified through configuration).

##### NOTE

> If you use spring-boot-starter-activemq, the necessary dependencies to connect or embed an ActiveMQ instance are provided, as is the Spring infrastructure to integrate with JMS.
>
> ActiveMQ configuration is controlled by external configuration properties in spring.activemq.\*. For
>
> example, you might declare the following section in application.properties:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> By default, a CachingConnectionFactory wraps the native ConnectionFactory with sensible settings that you can control by external configuration properties in spring.jms.\*:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> If you'd rather use native pooling, you can do so by adding a dependency to org.messaginghub:pooled-jms and configuring the JmsPoolConnectionFactory accordingly, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### TIP

> See ActiveMQProperties for more of the supported options. You can also register an arbitrary number of beans that implement ActiveMQConnectionFactoryCustomizer for more advanced customizations.
>
> By default, ActiveMQ creates a destination if it does not yet exist so that destinations are resolved against their provided names.

##### ActiveMQ Artemis Support

> Spring Boot can auto-configure a ConnectionFactory when it detects that ActiveMQ Artemis is available on the classpath. If the broker is present, an embedded broker is automatically started and configured (unless the mode property has been explicitly set). The supported modes are embedded (to make explicit that an embedded broker is required and that an error should occur if the broker is not available on the classpath) and native (to connect to a broker using the netty transport protocol). When the latter is configured, Spring Boot configures a ConnectionFactory that connects to a broker running on the local machine with the default settings.

##### NOTE

> If you use spring-boot-starter-artemis, the necessary dependencies to connect to an existing ActiveMQ Artemis instance are provided, as well as the Spring infrastructure to integrate with JMS. Adding org.apache.activemq:artemis-jms- server to your application lets you use embedded mode.
>
> ActiveMQ Artemis configuration is controlled by external configuration properties in
>
> spring.artemis.\*. For example, you might declare the following section in application.properties:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> When embedding the broker, you can choose if you want to enable persistence and list the destinations that should be made available. These can be specified as a comma-separated list to create them with the default options, or you can define bean(s) of type org.apache.activemq.artemis.jms.server.config.JMSQueueConfiguration or org.apache.activemq.artemis.jms.server.config.TopicConfiguration, for advanced queue and topic configurations, respectively.
>
> By default, a CachingConnectionFactory wraps the native ConnectionFactory with sensible settings that you can control by external configuration properties in spring.jms.\*:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> If you'd rather use native pooling, you can do so by adding a dependency to org.messaginghub:pooled-jms and configuring the JmsPoolConnectionFactory accordingly, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> See ArtemisProperties for more supported options.
>
> No JNDI lookup is involved, and destinations are resolved against their names, using either the name
>
> attribute in the Artemis configuration or the names provided through configuration.

##### Using a JNDI ConnectionFactory

> If you are running your application in an application server, Spring Boot tries to locate a JMS ConnectionFactory by using JNDI. By default, the java:/JmsXA and java:/XAConnectionFactory location are checked. You can use the spring.jms.jndi-name property if you need to specify an alternative location, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### Sending a Message

> Spring's JmsTemplate is auto-configured, and you can autowire it directly into your own beans, as shown in the following example:

##### NOTE

> JmsMessagingTemplate can be injected in a similar manner. If a DestinationResolver or a MessageConverter bean is defined, it is associated automatically to the auto- configured JmsTemplate.

##### Receiving a Message

> When the JMS infrastructure is present, any bean can be annotated with \@JmsListener to create a listener endpoint. If no JmsListenerContainerFactory has been defined, a default one is configured automatically. If a DestinationResolver, a MessageConverter, or a javax.jms.ExceptionListener beans are defined, they are associated automatically with the default factory.
>
> By default, the default factory is transactional. If you run in an infrastructure where a JtaTransactionManager is present, it is associated to the listener container by default. If not, the sessionTransacted flag is enabled. In that latter scenario, you can associate your local data store transaction to the processing of an incoming message by adding \@Transactional on your listener method (or a delegate thereof). This ensures that the incoming message is acknowledged, once the local transaction has completed. This also includes sending response messages that have been performed on the same JMS session.
>
> The following component creates a listener endpoint on the someQueue destination:
>
> **TIP** See the Javadoc of \@EnableJms for more details.
>
> If you need to create more JmsListenerContainerFactory instances or if you want to override the default, Spring Boot provides a DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactoryConfigurer that you can use to initialize a DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactory with the same settings as the one that is auto- configured.
>
> For instance, the following example exposes another factory that uses a specific MessageConverter:
>
> import javax.jms.ConnectionFactory;
>
> import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.jms.DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactoryConfigure r;
>
> import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
>
> import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
>
> import org.springframework.jms.config.DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactory;
>
> \@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false) public class MyJmsConfiguration {
>
> \@Bean
>
> public DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactory myFactory(DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactoryConfigurer configurer) {
>
> DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactory factory = new DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactory();
>
> ConnectionFactory connectionFactory = getCustomConnectionFactory(); configurer.configure(factory, connectionFactory); factory.setMessageConverter(new MyMessageConverter());
>
> return factory;
>
> }
>
> private ConnectionFactory getCustomConnectionFactory() { return \...
>
> }
>
> }
>
> Then you can use the factory in any \@JmsListener-annotated method as follows:

### AMQP

> The Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is a platform-neutral, wire-level protocol for message-oriented middleware. The Spring AMQP project applies core Spring concepts to the
>
> development of AMQP-based messaging solutions. Spring Boot offers several conveniences for working with AMQP through RabbitMQ, including the spring-boot-starter-amqp "Starter".

##### RabbitMQ support

> RabbitMQ is a lightweight, reliable, scalable, and portable message broker based on the AMQP protocol. Spring uses RabbitMQ to communicate through the AMQP protocol.
>
> RabbitMQ configuration is controlled by external configuration properties in spring.rabbitmq.\*. For example, you might declare the following section in application.properties:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> Alternatively, you could configure the same connection using the addresses attribute:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### NOTE

> When specifying addresses that way, the host and port properties are ignored. If the address uses the amqps protocol, SSL support is enabled automatically.
>
> See RabbitProperties for more of the supported property-based configuration options. To configure lower-level details of the RabbitMQ ConnectionFactory that is used by Spring AMQP, define a ConnectionFactoryCustomizer bean.
>
> If a ConnectionNameStrategy bean exists in the context, it will be automatically used to name connections created by the auto-configured CachingConnectionFactory.
>
> **TIP** See Understanding AMQP, the protocol used by RabbitMQ for more details.

##### Sending a Message

> Spring's AmqpTemplate and AmqpAdmin are auto-configured, and you can autowire them directly into your own beans, as shown in the following example:

##### NOTE

> RabbitMessagingTemplate can be injected in a similar manner. If a MessageConverter
>
> bean is defined, it is associated automatically to the auto-configured AmqpTemplate.
>
> If necessary, any org.springframework.amqp.core.Queue that is defined as a bean is automatically used to declare a corresponding queue on the RabbitMQ instance.
>
> To retry operations, you can enable retries on the AmqpTemplate (for example, in the event that the broker connection is lost):
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> Retries are disabled by default. You can also customize the RetryTemplate programmatically by declaring a RabbitRetryTemplateCustomizer bean.
>
> If you need to create more RabbitTemplate instances or if you want to override the default, Spring Boot provides a RabbitTemplateConfigurer bean that you can use to initialize a RabbitTemplate with the same settings as the factories used by the auto-configuration.

##### Receiving a Message

> When the Rabbit infrastructure is present, any bean can be annotated with \@RabbitListener to create a listener endpoint. If no RabbitListenerContainerFactory has been defined, a default SimpleRabbitListenerContainerFactory is automatically configured and you can switch to a direct container using the spring.rabbitmq.listener.type property. If a MessageConverter or a MessageRecoverer bean is defined, it is automatically associated with the default factory.
>
> The following sample component creates a listener endpoint on the someQueue queue:
>
> **TIP** See the Javadoc of \@EnableRabbit for more details.
>
> If you need to create more RabbitListenerContainerFactory instances or if you want to override the default, Spring Boot provides a SimpleRabbitListenerContainerFactoryConfigurer and a DirectRabbitListenerContainerFactoryConfigurer that you can use to initialize a SimpleRabbitListenerContainerFactory and a DirectRabbitListenerContainerFactory with the same settings as the factories used by the auto-configuration.

##### TIP

> It does not matter which container type you chose. Those two beans are exposed by the auto-configuration.
>
> For instance, the following configuration class exposes another factory that uses a specific

>
> ConnectionFactory connectionFactory = getCustomConnectionFactory(); configurer.configure(factory, connectionFactory); factory.setMessageConverter(new MyMessageConverter());
>
> return factory;

> private ConnectionFactory getCustomConnectionFactory() { return \...
>
> }
>
> }
>
> Then you can use the factory in any \@RabbitListener-annotated method, as follows:
>
> You can enable retries to handle situations where your listener throws an exception. By default, RejectAndDontRequeueRecoverer is used, but you can define a MessageRecoverer of your own. When retries are exhausted, the message is rejected and either dropped or routed to a dead-letter exchange if the broker is configured to do so. By default, retries are disabled. You can also customize the RetryTemplate programmatically by declaring a RabbitRetryTemplateCustomizer bean.

##### IMPORTANT

> By default, if retries are disabled and the listener throws an exception, the delivery is retried indefinitely. You can modify this behavior in two ways: Set the defaultRequeueRejected property to false so that zero re-deliveries are attempted or throw an AmqpRejectAndDontRequeueException to signal the message should be rejected. The latter is the mechanism used when retries are enabled and the maximum number of delivery attempts is reached.

### Apache Kafka Support

> Apache Kafka is supported by providing auto-configuration of the spring-kafka project.
>
> Kafka configuration is controlled by external configuration properties in spring.kafka.\*. For example, you might declare the following section in application.properties:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### TIP

> To create a topic on startup, add a bean of type NewTopic. If the topic already exists, the bean is ignored.
>
> See KafkaProperties for more supported options.

##### Sending a Message

> Spring's KafkaTemplate is auto-configured, and you can autowire it directly in your own beans, as shown in the following example:

##### NOTE

> If the property spring.kafka.producer.transaction-id-prefix is defined, a KafkaTransactionManager is automatically configured. Also, if a RecordMessageConverter bean is defined, it is automatically associated to the auto- configured KafkaTemplate.

##### Receiving a Message

> When the Apache Kafka infrastructure is present, any bean can be annotated with \@KafkaListener to create a listener endpoint. If no KafkaListenerContainerFactory has been defined, a default one is automatically configured with keys defined in spring.kafka.listener.\*.
>
> The following component creates a listener endpoint on the someTopic topic:
>
> If a KafkaTransactionManager bean is defined, it is automatically associated to the container factory. Similarly, if a RecordFilterStrategy, ErrorHandler, AfterRollbackProcessor or ConsumerAwareRebalanceListener bean is defined, it is automatically associated to the default factory.
>
> Depending on the listener type, a RecordMessageConverter or BatchMessageConverter bean is associated to the default factory. If only a RecordMessageConverter bean is present for a batch listener, it is wrapped in a BatchMessageConverter.
>
> **TIP** A custom ChainedKafkaTransactionManager must be marked \@Primary as it usually references the auto-configured KafkaTransactionManager bean.

##### Kafka Streams

> Spring for Apache Kafka provides a factory bean to create a StreamsBuilder object and manage the lifecycle of its streams. Spring Boot auto-configures the required KafkaStreamsConfiguration bean as long as kafka-streams is on the classpath and Kafka Streams is enabled via the \@EnableKafkaStreams annotation.
>
> Enabling Kafka Streams means that the application id and bootstrap servers must be set. The former can be configured using spring.kafka.streams.application-id, defaulting to spring.application.name if not set. The latter can be set globally or specifically overridden only for streams.
>
> Several additional properties are available using dedicated properties; other arbitrary Kafka properties can be set using the spring.kafka.streams.properties namespace. See also [Additional](\l) [Kafka Properties](\l) for more information.
>
> To use the factory bean, wire StreamsBuilder into your \@Bean as shown in the following example:
>
> import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Serdes; import org.apache.kafka.streams.KeyValue;
>
> import org.apache.kafka.streams.StreamsBuilder; import org.apache.kafka.streams.kstream.KStream; import org.apache.kafka.streams.kstream.Produced;
>
> import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
>
> import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration; import org.springframework.kafka.annotation.EnableKafkaStreams; import org.springframework.kafka.support.serializer.JsonSerde;
>
> \@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false) \@EnableKafkaStreams
>
> public class MyKafkaStreamsConfiguration {
>
> \@Bean
>
> public KStream\<Integer, String> kStream(StreamsBuilder streamsBuilder) { KStream\<Integer, String> stream = streamsBuilder.stream(\"ks1In\"); stream.map(this::uppercaseValue).to(\"ks1Out\", Produced.with(Serdes.Integer(),
>
> new JsonSerde\<\>()));
>
> return stream;
>
> }
>
> private KeyValue\<Integer, String> uppercaseValue(Integer key, String value) { return new KeyValue\<\>(key, value.toUpperCase());
>
> }
>
> }
>
> By default, the streams managed by the StreamBuilder object it creates are started automatically. You can customize this behavior using the spring.kafka.streams.auto-startup property.

##### Additional Kafka Properties

> The properties supported by auto configuration are shown in [Common Application Properties](\l). Note that, for the most part, these properties (hyphenated or camelCase) map directly to the Apache Kafka dotted properties. Refer to the Apache Kafka documentation for details.
>
> The first few of these properties apply to all components (producers, consumers, admins, and streams) but can be specified at the component level if you wish to use different values. Apache Kafka designates properties with an importance of HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW. Spring Boot auto- configuration supports all HIGH importance properties, some selected MEDIUM and LOW properties, and any properties that do not have a default value.
>
> Only a subset of the properties supported by Kafka are available directly through the KafkaProperties class. If you wish to configure the producer or consumer with additional properties that are not directly supported, use the following properties:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> This sets the common prop.one Kafka property to first (applies to producers, consumers and admins), the prop.two admin property to second, the prop.three consumer property to third, the prop.four producer property to fourth and the prop.five streams property to fifth.
>
> You can also configure the Spring Kafka JsonDeserializer as follows:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> Similarly, you can disable the JsonSerializer default behavior of sending type information in headers:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### IMPORTANT

> Properties set in this way override any configuration item that Spring Boot explicitly supports.

##### Testing with Embedded Kafka

> Spring for Apache Kafka provides a convenient way to test projects with an embedded Apache Kafka broker. To use this feature, annotate a test class with \@EmbeddedKafka from the spring-kafka- test module. For more information, please see the Spring for Apache Kafka reference manual.
>
> To make Spring Boot auto-configuration work with the aforementioned embedded Apache Kafka broker, you need to remap a system property for embedded broker addresses (populated by the EmbeddedKafkaBroker) into the Spring Boot configuration property for Apache Kafka. There are several ways to do that:

-   Provide a system property to map embedded broker addresses into spring.kafka.bootstrap- servers in the test class:

-   Configure a property name on the \@EmbeddedKafka annotation:

-   Use a placeholder in configuration properties:

> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

## Calling REST Services with RestTemplate

> If you need to call remote REST services from your application, you can use the Spring Framework's RestTemplate class. Since RestTemplate instances often need to be customized before being used, Spring Boot does not provide any single auto-configured RestTemplate bean. It does, however, auto- configure a RestTemplateBuilder, which can be used to create RestTemplate instances when needed. The auto-configured RestTemplateBuilder ensures that sensible HttpMessageConverters are applied to RestTemplate instances.
>
> The following code shows a typical example:

##### TIP

> RestTemplateBuilder includes a number of useful methods that can be used to quickly configure a RestTemplate. For example, to add BASIC auth support, you can use builder.basicAuthentication(\"user\", \"password\").build().

1.  **RestTemplate Customization**

> There are three main approaches to RestTemplate customization, depending on how broadly you want the customizations to apply.
>
> To make the scope of any customizations as narrow as possible, inject the auto-configured RestTemplateBuilder and then call its methods as required. Each method call returns a new RestTemplateBuilder instance, so the customizations only affect this use of the builder.
>
> To make an application-wide, additive customization, use a RestTemplateCustomizer bean. All such beans are automatically registered with the auto-configured RestTemplateBuilder and are applied to any templates that are built with it.
>
> The following example shows a customizer that configures the use of a proxy for all hosts except
>
> 192.168.0.5:

#### import org.apache.http.HttpException; import org.apache.http.HttpHost; import org.apache.http.HttpRequest;

> import org.apache.http.client.HttpClient;
>
> import org.apache.http.conn.routing.HttpRoutePlanner; import org.apache.http.impl.client.HttpClientBuilder; import org.apache.http.impl.conn.DefaultProxyRoutePlanner; import org.apache.http.protocol.HttpContext;
>
> import org.springframework.boot.web.client.RestTemplateCustomizer;
>
> import org.springframework.http.client.HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory; import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;
>
> public class MyRestTemplateCustomizer implements RestTemplateCustomizer { \@Override
>
> public void customize(RestTemplate restTemplate) { HttpRoutePlanner routePlanner = new CustomRoutePlanner(new
>
> HttpHost(\"proxy.example.com\")); HttpClient httpClient =
>
> HttpClientBuilder.create().setRoutePlanner(routePlanner).build(); restTemplate.setRequestFactory(new
>
> HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory(httpClient));
>
> }
>
> static class CustomRoutePlanner extends DefaultProxyRoutePlanner { CustomRoutePlanner(HttpHost proxy) {
>
> super(proxy);
>
> }
>
> \@Override
>
> public HttpHost determineProxy(HttpHost target, HttpRequest request, HttpContext context) throws HttpException {
>
> if (target.getHostName().equals(\"192.168.0.5\")) { return null;
>
> }
>
> return super.determineProxy(target, request, context);
>
> }
>
> }
>
> }
>
> Finally, you can also create your own RestTemplateBuilder bean. To prevent switching off the auto- configuration of a RestTemplateBuilder and prevent any RestTemplateCustomizer beans from being used, make sure to configure your custom instance with a RestTemplateBuilderConfigurer. The following example exposes a RestTemplateBuilder with what Spring Boot would auto-configure, except that custom connect and read timeouts are also specified:

#### import java.time.Duration;

> import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.client.RestTemplateBuilderConfigurer; import org.springframework.boot.web.client.RestTemplateBuilder;
>
> import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
>
> import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
>
> \@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
>
> public class MyRestTemplateBuilderConfiguration {
>
> \@Bean
>
> public RestTemplateBuilder restTemplateBuilder(RestTemplateBuilderConfigurer configurer) {
>
> return configurer.configure(new RestTemplateBuilder()).setConnectTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
>
> .setReadTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(2));
>
> }
>
> }
>
> The most extreme (and rarely used) option is to create your own RestTemplateBuilder bean without using a configurer. Doing so switches off the auto-configuration of a RestTemplateBuilder and prevents any RestTemplateCustomizer beans from being used.

## Calling REST Services with WebClient

> If you have Spring WebFlux on your classpath, you can also choose to use WebClient to call remote REST services. Compared to RestTemplate, this client has a more functional feel and is fully reactive. You can learn more about the WebClient in the dedicated section in the Spring Framework docs.
>
> Spring Boot creates and pre-configures a WebClient.Builder for you. It is strongly advised to inject it in your components and use it to create WebClient instances. Spring Boot is configuring that builder to share HTTP resources, reflect codecs setup in the same fashion as the server ones (see [WebFlux](\l) [HTTP codecs auto-configuration](\l)), and more.
>
> The following code shows a typical example:

### WebClient Runtime

> Spring Boot will auto-detect which ClientHttpConnector to use to drive WebClient, depending on the libraries available on the application classpath. For now, Reactor Netty and Jetty RS client are supported.
>
> The spring-boot-starter-webflux starter depends on io.projectreactor.netty:reactor-netty by default, which brings both server and client implementations. If you choose to use Jetty as a reactive server instead, you should add a dependency on the Jetty Reactive HTTP client library, org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-reactive-httpclient. Using the same technology for server and client has it advantages, as it will automatically share HTTP resources between client and server.
>
> Developers can override the resource configuration for Jetty and Reactor Netty by providing a custom ReactorResourceFactory or JettyResourceFactory bean - this will be applied to both clients and servers.
>
> If you wish to override that choice for the client, you can define your own ClientHttpConnector bean and have full control over the client configuration.
>
> You can learn more about the WebClient configuration options in the Spring Framework reference documentation.

### WebClient Customization

> There are three main approaches to WebClient customization, depending on how broadly you want the customizations to apply.
>
> To make the scope of any customizations as narrow as possible, inject the auto-configured WebClient.Builder and then call its methods as required. WebClient.Builder instances are stateful: Any change on the builder is reflected in all clients subsequently created with it. If you want to create several clients with the same builder, you can also consider cloning the builder with WebClient.Builder other = builder.clone();.
>
> To make an application-wide, additive customization to all WebClient.Builder instances, you can declare WebClientCustomizer beans and change the WebClient.Builder locally at the point of injection.
>
> Finally, you can fall back to the original API and use WebClient.create(). In that case, no auto- configuration or WebClientCustomizer is applied.

## Validation

> The method validation feature supported by Bean Validation 1.1 is automatically enabled as long as a JSR-303 implementation (such as Hibernate validator) is on the classpath. This lets bean methods be annotated with javax.validation constraints on their parameters and/or on their return value. Target classes with such annotated methods need to be annotated with the \@Validated annotation at the type level for their methods to be searched for inline constraint annotations.
>
> For instance, the following service triggers the validation of the first argument, making sure its size is between 8 and 10:

## Sending Email

> The Spring Framework provides an abstraction for sending email by using the JavaMailSender
>
> interface, and Spring Boot provides auto-configuration for it as well as a starter module.
>
> **TIP** See the reference documentation for a detailed explanation of how you can use
>
> JavaMailSender.
>
> If spring.mail.host and the relevant libraries (as defined by spring-boot-starter-mail) are available, a default JavaMailSender is created if none exists. The sender can be further customized by configuration items from the spring.mail namespace. See MailProperties for more details.
>
> In particular, certain default timeout values are infinite, and you may want to change that to avoid having a thread blocked by an unresponsive mail server, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> It is also possible to configure a JavaMailSender with an existing Session from JNDI:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> When a jndi-name is set, it takes precedence over all other Session-related settings.

## Distributed Transactions with JTA

> Spring Boot supports distributed JTA transactions across multiple XA resources by using an Atomikos embedded transaction manager. JTA transactions are also supported when deploying to a suitable Java EE Application Server.
>
> When a JTA environment is detected, Spring's JtaTransactionManager is used to manage transactions. Auto-configured JMS, DataSource, and JPA beans are upgraded to support XA transactions. You can use standard Spring idioms, such as \@Transactional, to participate in a distributed transaction. If you are within a JTA environment and still want to use local transactions, you can set the spring.jta.enabled property to false to disable the JTA auto-configuration.

### Using an Atomikos Transaction Manager

> Atomikos is a popular open source transaction manager which can be embedded into your Spring Boot application. You can use the spring-boot-starter-jta-atomikos starter to pull in the appropriate Atomikos libraries. Spring Boot auto-configures Atomikos and ensures that appropriate depends-on settings are applied to your Spring beans for correct startup and shutdown ordering.
>
> By default, Atomikos transaction logs are written to a transaction-logs directory in your application's home directory (the directory in which your application jar file resides). You can customize the location of this directory by setting a spring.jta.log-dir property in your application.properties file. Properties starting with spring.jta.atomikos.properties can also be used to customize the Atomikos UserTransactionServiceImp. See the AtomikosProperties Javadoc for complete details.

##### NOTE

> To ensure that multiple transaction managers can safely coordinate the same resource managers, each Atomikos instance must be configured with a unique ID. By default, this ID is the IP address of the machine on which Atomikos is running. To ensure uniqueness in production, you should configure the spring.jta.transaction-manager-id property with a different value for each instance of your application.

### Using a Java EE Managed Transaction Manager

> If you package your Spring Boot application as a war or ear file and deploy it to a Java EE application server, you can use your application server's built-in transaction manager. Spring Boot tries to auto-configure a transaction manager by looking at common JNDI locations (java:comp/UserTransaction, java:comp/TransactionManager, and so on). If you use a transaction service provided by your application server, you generally also want to ensure that all resources are managed by the server and exposed over JNDI. Spring Boot tries to auto-configure JMS by looking for a ConnectionFactory at the JNDI path (java:/JmsXA or java:/XAConnectionFactory), and you can use the [spring.datasource.jndi-name](\l) [property](\l) to configure your DataSource.

### Mixing XA and Non-XA JMS Connections

> When using JTA, the primary JMS ConnectionFactory bean is XA-aware and participates in distributed transactions. You can inject into your bean without needing to use any \@Qualifier:
>
> In some situations, you might want to process certain JMS messages by using a non-XA
>
> ConnectionFactory. For example, your JMS processing logic might take longer than the XA timeout. If you want to use a non-XA ConnectionFactory, you can the nonXaJmsConnectionFactory bean:
>
> For consistency, the jmsConnectionFactory bean is also provided by using the bean alias
>
> xaJmsConnectionFactory:

### Supporting an Alternative Embedded Transaction Manager

> The XAConnectionFactoryWrapper and XADataSourceWrapper interfaces can be used to support alternative embedded transaction managers. The interfaces are responsible for wrapping XAConnectionFactory and XADataSource beans and exposing them as regular ConnectionFactory and DataSource beans, which transparently enroll in the distributed transaction. DataSource and JMS auto-configuration use JTA variants, provided you have a JtaTransactionManager bean and appropriate XA wrapper beans registered within your ApplicationContext.
>
> The AtomikosXAConnectionFactoryWrapper and AtomikosXADataSourceWrapper provide good examples of how to write XA wrappers.

## Hazelcast

> If Hazelcast is on the classpath and a suitable configuration is found, Spring Boot auto-configures a
>
> HazelcastInstance that you can inject in your application.
>
> Spring Boot first attempts to create a client by checking the following configuration options:

-   The presence of a com.hazelcast.client.config.ClientConfig bean.

-   A configuration file defined by the spring.hazelcast.config property.

-   The presence of the hazelcast.client.config system property.

-   A hazelcast-client.xml in the working directory or at the root of the classpath.

-   A hazelcast-client.yaml in the working directory or at the root of the classpath.

> **NOTE** Spring Boot supports both Hazelcast 4 and Hazelcast 3. If you downgrade to Hazelcast 3, hazelcast-client should be added to the classpath to configure a client.
>
> If a client can't be created, Spring Boot attempts to configure an embedded server. If you define a com.hazelcast.config.Config bean, Spring Boot uses that. If your configuration defines an instance name, Spring Boot tries to locate an existing instance rather than creating a new one.
>
> You could also specify the Hazelcast configuration file to use through configuration, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> Otherwise, Spring Boot tries to find the Hazelcast configuration from the default locations: hazelcast.xml in the working directory or at the root of the classpath, or a .yaml counterpart in the same locations. We also check if the hazelcast.config system property is set. See the Hazelcast documentation for more details.
>
> **NOTE** Spring Boot also has [explicit caching support for Hazelcast](\l). If caching is enabled, the HazelcastInstance is automatically wrapped in a CacheManager implementation.

## Quartz Scheduler

> Spring Boot offers several conveniences for working with the Quartz scheduler, including the spring-boot-starter-quartz "Starter". If Quartz is available, a Scheduler is auto-configured (through the SchedulerFactoryBean abstraction).
>
> Beans of the following types are automatically picked up and associated with the Scheduler:

-   JobDetail: defines a particular Job. JobDetail instances can be built with the JobBuilder API.

-   Calendar.

-   Trigger: defines when a particular job is triggered.

> By default, an in-memory JobStore is used. However, it is possible to configure a JDBC-based store if a DataSource bean is available in your application and if the spring.quartz.job-store-type property is configured accordingly, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> When the JDBC store is used, the schema can be initialized on startup, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### WARNING

> By default, the database is detected and initialized by using the standard scripts provided with the Quartz library. These scripts drop existing tables, deleting all triggers on every restart. It is also possible to provide a custom script by setting the spring.quartz.jdbc.schema property.
>
> To have Quartz use a DataSource other than the application's main DataSource, declare a DataSource bean, annotating its \@Bean method with \@QuartzDataSource. Doing so ensures that the Quartz-specific DataSource is used by both the SchedulerFactoryBean and for schema initialization. Similarly, to have Quartz use a TransactionManager other than the application's main TransactionManager declare a TransactionManager bean, annotating its \@Bean method with \@QuartzTransactionManager.
>
> By default, jobs created by configuration will not overwrite already registered jobs that have been read from a persistent job store. To enable overwriting existing job definitions set the spring.quartz.overwrite-existing-jobs property.
>
> Quartz Scheduler configuration can be customized using spring.quartz properties and SchedulerFactoryBeanCustomizer beans, which allow programmatic SchedulerFactoryBean customization. Advanced Quartz configuration properties can be customized using spring.quartz.properties.\*.

##### NOTE

> In particular, an Executor bean is not associated with the scheduler as Quartz offers a way to configure the scheduler via spring.quartz.properties. If you need to customize the task executor, consider implementing SchedulerFactoryBeanCustomizer.
>
> Jobs can define setters to inject data map properties. Regular beans can also be injected in a similar manner, as shown in the following example:

## Task Execution and Scheduling

> In the absence of an Executor bean in the context, Spring Boot auto-configures a ThreadPoolTaskExecutor with sensible defaults that can be automatically associated to asynchronous task execution (\@EnableAsync) and Spring MVC asynchronous request processing.

##### TIP

> If you have defined a custom Executor in the context, regular task execution (i.e. \@EnableAsync) will use it transparently but the Spring MVC support will not be configured as it requires an AsyncTaskExecutor implementation (named applicationTaskExecutor). Depending on your target arrangement, you could change your Executor into a ThreadPoolTaskExecutor or define both a ThreadPoolTaskExecutor and an AsyncConfigurer wrapping your custom Executor.
>
> The auto-configured TaskExecutorBuilder allows you to easily create instances that reproduce what the auto-configuration does by default.
>
> The thread pool uses 8 core threads that can grow and shrink according to the load. Those default settings can be fine-tuned using the spring.task.execution namespace, as shown in the following
>
> example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> This changes the thread pool to use a bounded queue so that when the queue is full (100 tasks), the thread pool increases to maximum 16 threads. Shrinking of the pool is more aggressive as threads are reclaimed when they are idle for 10 seconds (rather than 60 seconds by default).
>
> A ThreadPoolTaskScheduler can also be auto-configured if need to be associated to scheduled task execution (e.g. \@EnableScheduling). The thread pool uses one thread by default and its settings can be fine-tuned using the spring.task.scheduling namespace, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> Both a TaskExecutorBuilder bean and a TaskSchedulerBuilder bean are made available in the context if a custom executor or scheduler needs to be created.

## Spring Integration

> Spring Boot offers several conveniences for working with Spring Integration, including the spring- boot-starter-integration "Starter". Spring Integration provides abstractions over messaging and also other transports such as HTTP, TCP, and others. If Spring Integration is available on your
>
> classpath, it is initialized through the \@EnableIntegration annotation. Spring Integration polling logic relies [on the auto-configured](\l) [TaskScheduler](\l).
>
> Spring Boot also configures some features that are triggered by the presence of additional Spring Integration modules. If spring-integration-jmx is also on the classpath, message processing statistics are published over JMX. If spring-integration-jdbc is available, the default database schema can be created on startup, as shown in the following line:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> If spring-integration-rsocket is available, developers can configure an RSocket server using \"spring.rsocket.server.\*\" properties and let it use IntegrationRSocketEndpoint or RSocketOutboundGateway components to handle incoming RSocket messages. This infrastructure can handle Spring Integration RSocket channel adapters and \@MessageMapping handlers (given \"spring.integration.rsocket.server.message-mapping-enabled\" is configured).
>
> Spring Boot can also auto-configure an ClientRSocketConnector using configuration properties:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> See the IntegrationAutoConfiguration and IntegrationProperties classes for more details.
>
> By default, if a Micrometer meterRegistry bean is present, Spring Integration metrics will be managed by Micrometer. If you wish to use legacy Spring Integration metrics, add a DefaultMetricsFactory bean to the application context.

## Spring Session

> Spring Boot provides Spring Session auto-configuration for a wide range of data stores. When building a Servlet web application, the following stores can be auto-configured:

-   JDBC

-   Redis

-   Hazelcast

-   MongoDB

> The Servlet auto-configuration replaces the need to use \@Enable\*HttpSession.
>
> When building a reactive web application, the following stores can be auto-configured:

-   Redis

-   MongoDB

> The reactive auto-configuration replaces the need to use \@Enable\*WebSession.
>
> If a single Spring Session module is present on the classpath, Spring Boot uses that store implementation automatically. If you have more than one implementation, you must choose the StoreType that you wish to use to store the sessions. For instance, to use JDBC as the back-end store, you can configure your application as follows:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> **TIP** You can disable Spring Session by setting the store-type to none.
>
> Each store has specific additional settings. For instance, it is possible to customize the name of the table for the JDBC store, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> For setting the timeout of the session you can use the spring.session.timeout property. If that property is not set with a Servlet web application, the auto-configuration falls back to the value of server.servlet.session.timeout.
>
> You can take control over Spring Session's configuration using \@Enable\*HttpSession (Servlet) or \@Enable\*WebSession (Reactive). This will cause the auto-configuration to back off. Spring Session can then be configured using the annotation's attributes rather than the previously described configuration properties.

## Monitoring and Management over JMX

> Java Management Extensions (JMX) provide a standard mechanism to monitor and manage applications. Spring Boot exposes the most suitable MBeanServer as a bean with an ID of mbeanServer. Any of your beans that are annotated with Spring JMX annotations (\@ManagedResource, \@ManagedAttribute, or \@ManagedOperation) are exposed to it.
>
> If your platform provides a standard MBeanServer, Spring Boot will use that and default to the VM
>
> MBeanServer if necessary. If all that fails, a new MBeanServer will be created. See the JmxAutoConfiguration class for more details.

## Testing

> Spring Boot provides a number of utilities and annotations to help when testing your application. Test support is provided by two modules: spring-boot-test contains core items, and spring-boot-
>
> test-autoconfigure supports auto-configuration for tests.
>
> Most developers use the spring-boot-starter-test "Starter", which imports both Spring Boot test modules as well as JUnit Jupiter, AssertJ, Hamcrest, and a number of other useful libraries.
>
> If you have tests that use JUnit 4, JUnit 5's vintage engine can be used to run them. To use the vintage engine, add a dependency on junit-vintage-engine, as shown in the following example:

##### TIP

> hamcrest-core is excluded in favor of org.hamcrest:hamcrest that is part of spring-boot-starter-test.

1.  **Test Scope Dependencies**

> The spring-boot-starter-test "Starter" (in the test scope) contains the following provided libraries:

-   JUnit 5: The de-facto standard for unit testing Java applications.

-   Spring Test & Spring Boot Test: Utilities and integration test support for Spring Boot applications.

-   AssertJ: A fluent assertion library.

-   Hamcrest: A library of matcher objects (also known as constraints or predicates).

-   Mockito: A Java mocking framework.

-   JSONassert: An assertion library for JSON.

-   JsonPath: XPath for JSON.

> We generally find these common libraries to be useful when writing tests. If these libraries do not suit your needs, you can add additional test dependencies of your own.

### Testing Spring Applications

> One of the major advantages of dependency injection is that it should make your code easier to unit test. You can instantiate objects by using the new operator without even involving Spring. You can also use *mock objects* instead of real dependencies.
>
> Often, you need to move beyond unit testing and start integration testing (with a Spring
>
> ApplicationContext). It is useful to be able to perform integration testing without requiring deployment of your application or needing to connect to other infrastructure.
>
> The Spring Framework includes a dedicated test module for such integration testing. You can declare a dependency directly to org.springframework:spring-test or use the spring-boot-starter- test "Starter" to pull it in transitively.
>
> If you have not used the spring-test module before, you should start by reading the relevant section of the Spring Framework reference documentation.

### Testing Spring Boot Applications

> A Spring Boot application is a Spring ApplicationContext, so nothing very special has to be done to test it beyond what you would normally do with a vanilla Spring context.
>
> **NOTE** External properties, logging, and other features of Spring Boot are installed in the context by default only if you use SpringApplication to create it.
>
> Spring Boot provides a \@SpringBootTest annotation, which can be used as an alternative to the standard spring-test \@ContextConfiguration annotation when you need Spring Boot features. The annotation works by [creating the](\l) [ApplicationContext](\l) [used in your tests through](\l) [SpringApplication](\l). In addition to \@SpringBootTest a number of other annotations are also provided for [testing more](\l) [specific slices](\l) of an application.

##### TIP

> If you are using JUnit 4, don't forget to also add \@RunWith(SpringRunner.class) to your test, otherwise the annotations will be ignored. If you are using JUnit 5, there's no need to add the equivalent \@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class) as \@SpringBootTest and the other @...Test annotations are already annotated with it.
>
> By default, \@SpringBootTest will not start a server. You can use the webEnvironment attribute of
>
> \@SpringBootTest to further refine how your tests run:

-   MOCK(Default) : Loads a web ApplicationContext and provides a mock web environment. Embedded servers are not started when using this annotation. If a web environment is not available on your classpath, this mode transparently falls back to creating a regular non-web ApplicationContext. It can be used in conjunction with [\@AutoConfigureMockMvc](\l) [or \@AutoConfigureWebTestClient](\l) for mock-based testing of your web application.

-   RANDOM_PORT: Loads a WebServerApplicationContext and provides a real web environment. Embedded servers are started and listen on a random port.

-   DEFINED_PORT: Loads a WebServerApplicationContext and provides a real web environment. Embedded servers are started and listen on a defined port (from your application.properties) or on the default port of 8080.

-   NONE: Loads an ApplicationContext by using SpringApplication but does not provide *any* web environment (mock or otherwise).

##### NOTE

> If your test is \@Transactional, it rolls back the transaction at the end of each test method by default. However, as using this arrangement with either RANDOM_PORT or DEFINED_PORT implicitly provides a real servlet environment, the HTTP client and server run in separate threads and, thus, in separate transactions. Any transaction initiated on the server does not roll back in this case.

##### NOTE

> \@SpringBootTest with webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT will also start the management server on a separate random port if your application uses a different port for the management server.

##### Detecting Web Application Type

> If Spring MVC is available, a regular MVC-based application context is configured. If you have only Spring WebFlux, we'll detect that and configure a WebFlux-based application context instead.
>
> If both are present, Spring MVC takes precedence. If you want to test a reactive web application in this scenario, you must set the spring.main.web-application-type property:

##### Detecting Test Configuration

> If you are familiar with the Spring Test Framework, you may be used to using \@ContextConfiguration(classes=...) in order to specify which Spring \@Configuration to load. Alternatively, you might have often used nested \@Configuration classes within your test.
>
> When testing Spring Boot applications, this is often not required. Spring Boot's @\*Test annotations search for your primary configuration automatically whenever you do not explicitly define one.
>
> The search algorithm works up from the package that contains the test until it finds a class annotated with \@SpringBootApplication or \@SpringBootConfiguration. As long as you [structured your](\l) [code](\l) in a sensible way, your main configuration is usually found.

##### NOTE

> If you use a [test annotation to test a more specific slice of your application](\l), you should avoid adding configuration settings that are specific to a particular area on the [main method's application class](\l).
>
> The underlying component scan configuration of \@SpringBootApplication defines exclude filters that are used to make sure slicing works as expected. If you are using an explicit \@ComponentScan directive on your \@SpringBootApplication-annotated class, be aware that those filters will be disabled. If you are using slicing, you should define them again.
>
> If you want to customize the primary configuration, you can use a nested \@TestConfiguration class. Unlike a nested \@Configuration class, which would be used instead of your application's primary configuration, a nested \@TestConfiguration class is used in addition to your application's primary configuration.

##### NOTE

> Spring's test framework caches application contexts between tests. Therefore, as long as your tests share the same configuration (no matter how it is discovered), the potentially time-consuming process of loading the context happens only once.

##### Excluding Test Configuration

> If your application uses component scanning (for example, if you use \@SpringBootApplication or \@ComponentScan), you may find top-level configuration classes that you created only for specific tests accidentally get picked up everywhere.
>
> As we [have seen earlier](\l), \@TestConfiguration can be used on an inner class of a test to customize the primary configuration. When placed on a top-level class, \@TestConfiguration indicates that classes in src/test/java should not be picked up by scanning. You can then import that class explicitly where it is required, as shown in the following example:

##### NOTE

> If you directly use \@ComponentScan (that is, not through \@SpringBootApplication) you need to register the TypeExcludeFilter with it. See the Javadoc for details.

##### Using Application Arguments

> If your application expects [arguments](\l), you can have \@SpringBootTest inject them using the args
>
> attribute.

##### Testing with a mock environment

> By default, \@SpringBootTest does not start the server. If you have web endpoints that you want to test against this mock environment, you can additionally configure MockMvc as shown in the following example:
>
> import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
>
> import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
>
> import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.servlet.AutoConfigureMockMvc; import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
>
> import org.springframework.test.web.servlet.MockMvc;
>
> import static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.request.MockMvcRequestBuilders.get; import static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.result.MockMvcResultMatchers.content;
>
> import static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.result.MockMvcResultMatchers.status;
>
> \@SpringBootTest \@AutoConfigureMockMvc class MyMockMvcTests {
>
> \@Test
>
> void exampleTest(\@Autowired MockMvc mvc) throws Exception {
>
> mvc.perform(get(\"/\")).andExpect(status().isOk()).andExpect(content().string(\"Hello World\"));
>
> }
>
> }

##### TIP

> If you want to focus only on the web layer and not start a complete
>
> ApplicationContext, consider [using](\l) [\@WebMvcTest](\l) [instead](\l).
>
> Alternatively, you can configure a WebTestClient as shown in the following example:

##### TIP

> Testing within a mocked environment is usually faster than running with a full Servlet container. However, since mocking occurs at the Spring MVC layer, code that relies on lower-level Servlet container behavior cannot be directly tested with MockMvc.
>
> For example, Spring Boot's error handling is based on the "error page" support provided by the Servlet container. This means that, whilst you can test your MVC layer throws and handles exceptions as expected, you cannot directly test that a specific [custom error page](\l) is rendered. If you need to test these lower-level concerns, you can start a fully running server as described in the next section.

##### Testing with a running server

> If you need to start a full running server, we recommend that you use random ports. If you use \@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment=WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT), an available port is picked at random each time your test runs.
>
> The \@LocalServerPort annotation can be used to [inject the actual port used](\l) into your test. For convenience, tests that need to make REST calls to the started server can additionally \@Autowire a WebTestClient, which resolves relative links to the running server and comes with a dedicated API for verifying responses, as shown in the following example:
>
> This setup requires spring-webflux on the classpath. If you can't or won't add webflux, Spring Boot also provides a TestRestTemplate facility:

#### import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

> import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired; import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
>
> import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment; import org.springframework.boot.test.web.client.TestRestTemplate;
>
> import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;
>
> \@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT) class MyRandomPortTestRestTemplateTests {
>
> \@Test
>
> void exampleTest(\@Autowired TestRestTemplate restTemplate) { String body = restTemplate.getForObject(\"/\", String.class); assertThat(body).isEqualTo(\"Hello World\");
>
> }
>
> }

##### Customizing WebTestClient

> To customize the WebTestClient bean, configure a WebTestClientBuilderCustomizer bean. Any such beans are called with the WebTestClient.Builder that is used to create the WebTestClient.

##### Using JMX

> As the test context framework caches context, JMX is disabled by default to prevent identical components to register on the same domain. If such test needs access to an MBeanServer, consider marking it dirty as well:

##### Using Metrics

> Regardless of your classpath, meter registries, except the in-memory backed, are not auto- configured when using \@SpringBootTest.
>
> If you need to export metrics to a different backend as part of an integration test, annotate it with
>
> \@AutoConfigureMetrics.

##### Mocking and Spying Beans

> When running tests, it is sometimes necessary to mock certain components within your application context. For example, you may have a facade over some remote service that is unavailable during development. Mocking can also be useful when you want to simulate failures that might be hard to trigger in a real environment.
>
> Spring Boot includes a \@MockBean annotation that can be used to define a Mockito mock for a bean inside your ApplicationContext. You can use the annotation to add new beans or replace a single existing bean definition. The annotation can be used directly on test classes, on fields within your test, or on \@Configuration classes and fields. When used on a field, the instance of the created mock is also injected. Mock beans are automatically reset after each test method.
>
> If your test uses one of Spring Boot's test annotations (such as \@SpringBootTest), this feature is automatically enabled. To use this feature with a different arrangement, listeners must be explicitly added, as shown in the following example:

##### NOTE

> The following example replaces an existing RemoteService bean with a mock implementation:

##### NOTE

> \@MockBean cannot be used to mock the behavior of a bean that's exercised during application context refresh. By the time the test is executed, the application context refresh has completed and it is too late to configure the mocked behavior. We recommend using a \@Bean method to create and configure the mock in this situation.
>
> Additionally, you can use \@SpyBean to wrap any existing bean with a Mockito spy. See the Javadoc for full details.

##### NOTE

> CGLib proxies, such as those created for scoped beans, declare the proxied methods as final. This stops Mockito from functioning correctly as it cannot mock or spy on final methods in its default configuration. If you want to mock or spy on such a bean, configure Mockito to use its inline mock maker by adding org.mockito:mockito-inline to your application's test dependencies. This allows Mockito to mock and spy on final methods.

##### NOTE

> While Spring's test framework caches application contexts between tests and reuses a context for tests sharing the same configuration, the use of \@MockBean or \@SpyBean influences the cache key, which will most likely increase the number of contexts.

##### TIP

> If you are using \@SpyBean to spy on a bean with \@Cacheable methods that refer to parameters by name, your application must be compiled with -parameters. This ensures that the parameter names are available to the caching infrastructure once the bean has been spied upon.

##### TIP

> When you are using \@SpyBean to spy on a bean that is proxied by Spring, you may need to remove Spring's proxy in some situations, for example when setting expectations using given or when. Use AopTestUtils.getTargetObject(yourProxiedSpy) to do so.

##### Auto-configured Tests

> Spring Boot's auto-configuration system works well for applications but can sometimes be a little too much for tests. It often helps to load only the parts of the configuration that are required to test a "slice" of your application. For example, you might want to test that Spring MVC controllers are mapping URLs correctly, and you do not want to involve database calls in those tests, or you might want to test JPA entities, and you are not interested in the web layer when those tests run.
>
> The spring-boot-test-autoconfigure module includes a number of annotations that can be used to automatically configure such "slices". Each of them works in a similar way, providing a @...Test annotation that loads the ApplicationContext and one or more \@AutoConfigure... annotations that can be used to customize auto-configuration settings.

##### NOTE

> Each slice restricts component scan to appropriate components and loads a very restricted set of auto-configuration classes. If you need to exclude one of them, most @...Test annotations provide an excludeAutoConfiguration attribute. Alternatively, you can use \@ImportAutoConfiguration#exclude.

##### NOTE

> Including multiple "slices" by using several @...Test annotations in one test is not supported. If you need multiple "slices", pick one of the @...Test annotations and include the \@AutoConfigure... annotations of the other "slices" by hand.

##### TIP

> It is also possible to use the \@AutoConfigure... annotations with the standard \@SpringBootTest annotation. You can use this combination if you are not interested in "slicing" your application but you want some of the auto-configured test beans.

##### Auto-configured JSON Tests

> To test that object JSON serialization and deserialization is working as expected, you can use the \@JsonTest annotation. \@JsonTest auto-configures the available supported JSON mapper, which can be one of the following libraries:

-   Jackson ObjectMapper, any \@JsonComponent beans and any Jackson Modules

-   Gson

-   Jsonb

##### TIP

> A list of the auto-configurations that are enabled by \@JsonTest can be [found in the](\l) [appendix](\l).
>
> If you need to configure elements of the auto-configuration, you can use the
>
> \@AutoConfigureJsonTesters annotation.
>
> Spring Boot includes AssertJ-based helpers that work with the JSONAssert and JsonPath libraries to check that JSON appears as expected. The JacksonTester, GsonTester, JsonbTester, and BasicJsonTester classes can be used for Jackson, Gson, Jsonb, and Strings respectively. Any helper fields on the test class can be \@Autowired when using \@JsonTest. The following example shows a test class for Jackson:

#### import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

> import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired; import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.json.JsonTest; import org.springframework.boot.test.json.JacksonTester;
>
> import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat; \@JsonTest
>
> class MyJsonTests {
>
> \@Autowired
>
> private JacksonTester\<VehicleDetails> json;
>
> \@Test
>
> void serialize() throws Exception {
>
> VehicleDetails details = new VehicleDetails(\"Honda\", \"Civic\");
>
> // Assert against a \`.json\` file in the same package as the test assertThat(this.json.write(details)).isEqualToJson(\"expected.json\");
>
> // Or use JSON path based assertions assertThat(this.json.write(details)).hasJsonPathStringValue(\"@.make\");
>
> assertThat(this.json.write(details)).extractingJsonPathStringValue(\"@.make\").isEqualTo (\"Honda\");
>
> }
>
> \@Test
>
> void deserialize() throws Exception {
>
> String content = \"{\\\"make\\\":\\\"Ford\\\",\\\"model\\\":\\\"Focus\\\"}\"; assertThat(this.json.parse(content)).isEqualTo(new VehicleDetails(\"Ford\",
>
> \"Focus\"));
>
> assertThat(this.json.parseObject(content).getMake()).isEqualTo(\"Ford\");
>
> }
>
> }

##### NOTE

> JSON helper classes can also be used directly in standard unit tests. To do so, call the
>
> initFields method of the helper in your \@Before method if you do not use \@JsonTest.
>
> If you're using Spring Boot's AssertJ-based helpers to assert on a number value at a given JSON path, you might not be able to use isEqualTo depending on the type. Instead, you can use AssertJ's satisfies to assert that the value matches the given condition. For instance, the following example asserts that the actual number is a float value close to 0.15 within an offset of 0.01.

##### Auto-configured Spring MVC Tests

> To test whether Spring MVC controllers are working as expected, use the \@WebMvcTest annotation. \@WebMvcTest auto-configures the Spring MVC infrastructure and limits scanned beans to \@Controller, \@ControllerAdvice, \@JsonComponent, Converter, GenericConverter, Filter, HandlerInterceptor, WebMvcConfigurer, and HandlerMethodArgumentResolver. Regular \@Component and \@ConfigurationProperties beans are not scanned when the \@WebMvcTest annotation is used. \@EnableConfigurationProperties can be used to include \@ConfigurationProperties beans.
>
> **TIP** A list of the auto-configuration settings that are enabled by \@WebMvcTest can be [found](\l) [in the appendix](\l).
>
> **TIP** If you need to register extra components, such as the Jackson Module, you can import additional configuration classes by using \@Import on your test.
>
> Often, \@WebMvcTest is limited to a single controller and is used in combination with \@MockBean to provide mock implementations for required collaborators.
>
> \@WebMvcTest also auto-configures MockMvc. Mock MVC offers a powerful way to quickly test MVC controllers without needing to start a full HTTP server.
>
> **TIP** You can also auto-configure MockMvc in a non-\@WebMvcTest (such as \@SpringBootTest) by annotating it with \@AutoConfigureMockMvc. The following example uses MockMvc:

#### import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

> import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
>
> import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.servlet.WebMvcTest; import org.springframework.boot.test.mock.mockito.MockBean;
>
> import org.springframework.http.MediaType;
>
> import org.springframework.test.web.servlet.MockMvc;
>
> import static org.mockito.BDDMockito.given;
>
> import static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.request.MockMvcRequestBuilders.get; import static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.result.MockMvcResultMatchers.content;
>
> import static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.result.MockMvcResultMatchers.status;
>
> \@WebMvcTest(UserVehicleController.class) class MyControllerTests {
>
> \@Autowired
>
> private MockMvc mvc;
>
> \@MockBean
>
> private UserVehicleService userVehicleService;
>
> \@Test
>
> void testExample() throws Exception { given(this.userVehicleService.getVehicleDetails(\"sboot\"))
>
> .willReturn(new VehicleDetails(\"Honda\", \"Civic\")); this.mvc.perform(get(\"/sboot/vehicle\").accept(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN))
>
> .andExpect(status().isOk())
>
> .andExpect(content().string(\"Honda Civic\"));
>
> }
>
> }

##### TIP

> If you need to configure elements of the auto-configuration (for example, when servlet filters should be applied) you can use attributes in the \@AutoConfigureMockMvc annotation.
>
> If you use HtmlUnit or Selenium, auto-configuration also provides an HtmlUnit WebClient bean and/or a Selenium WebDriver bean. The following example uses HtmlUnit:

#### import com.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.WebClient; import com.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.html.HtmlPage; import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

> import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
>
> import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.servlet.WebMvcTest; import org.springframework.boot.test.mock.mockito.MockBean;
>
> import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat; import static org.mockito.BDDMockito.given;
>
> \@WebMvcTest(UserVehicleController.class) class MyHtmlUnitTests {
>
> \@Autowired
>
> private WebClient webClient;
>
> \@MockBean
>
> private UserVehicleService userVehicleService;
>
> \@Test
>
> void testExample() throws Exception { given(this.userVehicleService.getVehicleDetails(\"sboot\")).willReturn(new
>
> VehicleDetails(\"Honda\", \"Civic\"));
>
> HtmlPage page = this.webClient.getPage(\"/sboot/vehicle.html\"); assertThat(page.getBody().getTextContent()).isEqualTo(\"Honda Civic\");
>
> }
>
> }

##### NOTE

> By default, Spring Boot puts WebDriver beans in a special "scope" to ensure that the driver exits after each test and that a new instance is injected. If you do not want this behavior, you can add \@Scope(\"singleton\") to your WebDriver \@Bean definition.

##### WARNING

> The webDriver scope created by Spring Boot will replace any user defined scope of the same name. If you define your own webDriver scope you may find it stops working when you use \@WebMvcTest.
>
> If you have Spring Security on the classpath, \@WebMvcTest will also scan WebSecurityConfigurer beans. Instead of disabling security completely for such tests, you can use Spring Security's test support. More details on how to use Spring Security's MockMvc support can be found in this *[Testing](\l)* [*With Spring Security*](\l) how-to section.
>
> **TIP** Sometimes writing Spring MVC tests is not enough; Spring Boot can help you run [full](\l) [end-to-end tests with an actual server](\l).

##### Auto-configured Spring WebFlux Tests

> To test that Spring WebFlux controllers are working as expected, you can use the \@WebFluxTest annotation. \@WebFluxTest auto-configures the Spring WebFlux infrastructure and limits scanned beans to \@Controller, \@ControllerAdvice, \@JsonComponent, Converter, GenericConverter, WebFilter, and WebFluxConfigurer. Regular \@Component and \@ConfigurationProperties beans are not scanned when the \@WebFluxTest annotation is used. \@EnableConfigurationProperties can be used to include \@ConfigurationProperties beans.
>
> **TIP** A list of the auto-configurations that are enabled by \@WebFluxTest can be [found in the](\l) [appendix](\l).
>
> **TIP** If you need to register extra components, such as Jackson Module, you can import additional configuration classes using \@Import on your test.
>

>
> annotation to provide mock implementations for required collaborators.
>
> \@WebFluxTest also auto-configures WebTestClient, which offers a powerful way to quickly test WebFlux controllers without needing to start a full HTTP server.

##### TIP

> You can also auto-configure WebTestClient in a non-\@WebFluxTest (such as \@SpringBootTest) by annotating it with \@AutoConfigureWebTestClient. The following example shows a class that uses both \@WebFluxTest and a WebTestClient:

#### import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

> import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
>
> import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.reactive.WebFluxTest; import org.springframework.boot.test.mock.mockito.MockBean;
>
> import org.springframework.http.MediaType;
>
> import org.springframework.test.web.reactive.server.WebTestClient; import static org.mockito.BDDMockito.given;
>
> \@WebFluxTest(UserVehicleController.class) class MyControllerTests {
>
> \@Autowired
>
> private WebTestClient webClient;
>
> \@MockBean
>
> private UserVehicleService userVehicleService;
>
> \@Test
>
> void testExample() throws Exception { given(this.userVehicleService.getVehicleDetails(\"sboot\"))
>
> .willReturn(new VehicleDetails(\"Honda\", \"Civic\"));
>
> this.webClient.get().uri(\"/sboot/vehicle\").accept(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN).exchange()
>
> .expectStatus().isOk()
>
> .expectBody(String.class).isEqualTo(\"Honda Civic\");
>
> }
>
> }

##### TIP

> This setup is only supported by WebFlux applications as using WebTestClient in a mocked web application only works with WebFlux at the moment.

##### NOTE

> \@WebFluxTest cannot detect routes registered via the functional web framework. For testing RouterFunction beans in the context, consider importing your RouterFunction yourself via \@Import or using \@SpringBootTest.

##### NOTE

> \@WebFluxTest cannot detect custom security configuration registered via a \@Bean of type SecurityWebFilterChain. To include that in your test, you will need to import the configuration that registers the bean via \@Import or use \@SpringBootTest.

##### TIP

> Sometimes writing Spring WebFlux tests is not enough; Spring Boot can help you run [full end-to-end tests with an actual server](\l).

##### Auto-configured Data Cassandra Tests

> You can use \@DataCassandraTest to test Cassandra applications. By default, it configures a CassandraTemplate, scans for \@Table classes, and configures Spring Data Cassandra repositories. Regular \@Component and \@ConfigurationProperties beans are not scanned when the \@DataCassandraTest annotation is used. \@EnableConfigurationProperties can be used to include \@ConfigurationProperties beans. (For more about using Cassandra with Spring Boot, see \" [Cassandra](\l)\", earlier in this chapter.)
>
> **TIP** A list of the auto-configuration settings that are enabled by \@DataCassandraTest can be [found in the appendix](\l).
>
> The following example shows a typical setup for using Cassandra tests in Spring Boot:

##### Auto-configured Data JPA Tests

> You can use the \@DataJpaTest annotation to test JPA applications. By default, it scans for \@Entity classes and configures Spring Data JPA repositories. If an embedded database is available on the classpath, it configures one as well. SQL queries are logged by default by setting the spring.jpa.show-sql property to true. This can be disabled using the showSql() attribute of the annotation.
>
> Regular \@Component and \@ConfigurationProperties beans are not scanned when the \@DataJpaTest annotation is used. \@EnableConfigurationProperties can be used to include \@ConfigurationProperties beans.
>
> **TIP** A list of the auto-configuration settings that are enabled by \@DataJpaTest can be [found](\l) [in the appendix](\l).

> By default, data JPA tests are transactional and roll back at the end of each test. See the relevant section in the Spring Framework Reference Documentation for more details. If that is not what you want, you can disable transaction management for a test or for the whole class as follows:
>
> Data JPA tests may also inject a TestEntityManager bean, which provides an alternative to the standard JPA EntityManager that is specifically designed for tests. If you want to use TestEntityManager outside of \@DataJpaTest instances, you can also use the \@AutoConfigureTestEntityManager annotation. A JdbcTemplate is also available if you need that. The following example shows the \@DataJpaTest annotation in use:
>
> In-memory embedded databases generally work well for tests, since they are fast and do not require any installation. If, however, you prefer to run tests against a real database you can use the \@AutoConfigureTestDatabase annotation, as shown in the following example:

##### Auto-configured JDBC Tests

> \@JdbcTest is similar to \@DataJpaTest but is for tests that only require a DataSource and do not use Spring Data JDBC. By default, it configures an in-memory embedded database and a JdbcTemplate. Regular \@Component and \@ConfigurationProperties beans are not scanned when the \@JdbcTest annotation is used. \@EnableConfigurationProperties can be used to include \@ConfigurationProperties beans.

##### Auto-configured jOOQ Tests

> You can use \@JooqTest in a similar fashion as \@JdbcTest but for jOOQ-related tests. As jOOQ relies heavily on a Java-based schema that corresponds with the database schema, the existing DataSource is used. If you want to replace it with an in-memory database, you can use \@AutoConfigureTestDatabase to override those settings. (For more about using jOOQ with Spring Boot, see \"[Using jOOQ](\l)\", earlier in this chapter.) Regular \@Component and \@ConfigurationProperties beans are not scanned when the \@JooqTest annotation is used. \@EnableConfigurationProperties can be used to include \@ConfigurationProperties beans.

##### Auto-configured Data MongoDB Tests

> You can use \@DataMongoTest to test MongoDB applications. By default, it configures an in-memory embedded MongoDB (if available), configures a MongoTemplate, scans for \@Document classes, and configures Spring Data MongoDB repositories. Regular \@Component and \@ConfigurationProperties beans are not scanned when the \@DataMongoTest annotation is used. \@EnableConfigurationProperties can be used to include \@ConfigurationProperties beans.

> Transactional tests are not supported with reactive access. If you are using this style, you must configure \@DataNeo4jTest tests as described above.

##### Auto-configured Data Redis Tests

> You can use \@DataRedisTest to test Redis applications. By default, it scans for \@RedisHash classes and configures Spring Data Redis repositories. Regular \@Component and \@ConfigurationProperties beans are not scanned when the \@DataRedisTest annotation is used. \@EnableConfigurationProperties can be used to include \@ConfigurationProperties beans.

##### Auto-configured Spring REST Docs Tests

> You can use the \@AutoConfigureRestDocs annotation to use Spring REST Docs in your tests with Mock MVC, REST Assured, or WebTestClient. It removes the need for the JUnit extension in Spring REST Docs.
>
> \@AutoConfigureRestDocs can be used to override the default output directory (target/generated- snippets if you are using Maven or build/generated-snippets if you are using Gradle). It can also be used to configure the host, scheme, and port that appears in any documented URIs.
>
> **Auto-configured Spring REST Docs Tests with Mock MVC**
>
> \@AutoConfigureRestDocs customizes the MockMvc bean to use Spring REST Docs when testing Servlet- based web applications. You can inject it by using \@Autowired and use it in your tests as you normally would when using Mock MVC and Spring REST Docs, as shown in the following example:

#### import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

>
> If you require more control over Spring REST Docs configuration than offered by the attributes of \@AutoConfigureRestDocs, you can use a RestDocsMockMvcConfigurationCustomizer bean, as shown in the following example:
>
> If you want to make use of Spring REST Docs support for a parameterized output directory, you can create a RestDocumentationResultHandler bean. The auto-configuration calls alwaysDo with this result handler, thereby causing each MockMvc call to automatically generate the default snippets. The following example shows a RestDocumentationResultHandler being defined:
>
> **Auto-configured Spring REST Docs Tests with WebTestClient**
>
> \@AutoConfigureRestDocs can also be used with WebTestClient when testing reactive web applications. You can inject it by using \@Autowired and use it in your tests as you normally would when using \@WebFluxTest and Spring REST Docs, as shown in the following example:

> If you require more control over Spring REST Docs configuration than offered by the attributes of \@AutoConfigureRestDocs, you can use a RestDocsWebTestClientConfigurationCustomizer bean, as shown in the following example:
>
> **Auto-configured Spring REST Docs Tests with REST Assured**
>
> \@AutoConfigureRestDocs makes a RequestSpecification bean, preconfigured to use Spring REST Docs, available to your tests. You can inject it by using \@Autowired and use it in your tests as you normally would when using REST Assured and Spring REST Docs, as shown in the following example:

##### Auto-configured Spring Web Services Tests

> You can use \@WebServiceClientTest to test applications that use call web services using the Spring Web Services project. By default, it configures a mock WebServiceServer bean and automatically customizes your WebServiceTemplateBuilder. (For more about using Web Services with Spring Boot, see \"[Web Services](\l)\", earlier in this chapter.)

##### Additional Auto-configuration and Slicing

> Each slice provides one or more \@AutoConfigure... annotations that namely defines the auto- configurations that should be included as part of a slice. Additional auto-configurations can be added on a test-by-test basis by creating a custom \@AutoConfigure... annotation or by adding \@ImportAutoConfiguration to the test as shown in the following example:

##### NOTE

> Make sure to not use the regular \@Import annotation to import auto-configurations as they are handled in a specific way by Spring Boot.
>
> Alternatively, additional auto-configurations can be added for any use of a slice annotation by registering them in META-INF/spring.factories as shown in the following example:

##### TIP

> A slice or \@AutoConfigure... annotation can be customized this way as long as it is meta- annotated with \@ImportAutoConfiguration.

##### User Configuration and Slicing

> If you [structure your code](\l) in a sensible way, your \@SpringBootApplication class is [used by default](\l) as the configuration of your tests.
>
> It then becomes important not to litter the application's main class with configuration settings that are specific to a particular area of its functionality.
>
> Assume that you are using Spring Batch and you rely on the auto-configuration for it. You could define your \@SpringBootApplication as follows:
>
> Because this class is the source configuration for the test, any slice test actually tries to start Spring
>
> Batch, which is definitely not what you want to do. A recommended approach is to move that area- specific configuration to a separate \@Configuration class at the same level as your application, as shown in the following example:

##### NOTE

> Depending on the complexity of your application, you may either have a single \@Configuration class for your customizations or one class per domain area. The latter approach lets you enable it in one of your tests, if necessary, with the \@Import annotation.
>
> Test slices exclude \@Configuration classes from scanning. For example, for a \@WebMvcTest, the following configuration will not include the given WebMvcConfigurer bean in the application context loaded by the test slice:
>
> The configuration below will, however, cause the custom WebMvcConfigurer to be loaded by the test slice.
>
> Another source of confusion is classpath scanning. Assume that, while you structured your code in a sensible way, you need to scan an additional package. Your application may resemble the following code:
>
> Doing so effectively overrides the default component scan directive with the side effect of scanning those two packages regardless of the slice that you chose. For instance, a \@DataJpaTest seems to suddenly scan components and user configurations of your application. Again, moving the custom directive to a separate class is a good way to fix this issue.

##### TIP

> If this is not an option for you, you can create a \@SpringBootConfiguration somewhere in the hierarchy of your test so that it is used instead. Alternatively, you can specify a source for your test, which disables the behavior of finding a default one.

##### Using Spock to Test Spring Boot Applications

> Spock 2.x can be used to test a Spring Boot application. To do so, add a dependency on Spock's spock-spring module to your application's build. spock-spring integrates Spring's test framework into Spock. See the documentation for Spock's Spring module for further details.

### Test Utilities

> A few test utility classes that are generally useful when testing your application are packaged as part of spring-boot.

##### ConfigDataApplicationContextInitializer

> ConfigDataApplicationContextInitializer is an ApplicationContextInitializer that you can apply to your tests to load Spring Boot application.properties files. You can use it when you do not need the full set of features provided by \@SpringBootTest, as shown in the following example:

##### NOTE

> Using ConfigDataApplicationContextInitializer alone does not provide support for \@Value(\"\${...}\") injection. Its only job is to ensure that application.properties files are loaded into Spring's Environment. For \@Value support, you need to either additionally configure a PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer or use \@SpringBootTest, which auto-configures one for you.

##### TestPropertyValues

> TestPropertyValues lets you quickly add properties to a ConfigurableEnvironment or
>
> ConfigurableApplicationContext. You can call it with key=value strings, as follows:

##### OutputCapture

> OutputCapture is a JUnit Extension that you can use to capture System.out and System.err output. To use add \@ExtendWith(OutputCaptureExtension.class) and inject CapturedOutput as an argument to your test class constructor or test method as follows:

##### TestRestTemplate

> TestRestTemplate is a convenience alternative to Spring's RestTemplate that is useful in integration tests. You can get a vanilla template or one that sends Basic HTTP authentication (with a username and password). In either case, the template is fault tolerant. This means that it behaves in a test- friendly way by not throwing exceptions on 4xx and 5xx errors. Instead, such errors can be detected via the returned ResponseEntity and its status code.

##### TIP

> Spring Framework 5.0 provides a new WebTestClient that works for [WebFlux](\l) [integration tests](\l) and both [WebFlux and MVC end-to-end testing](\l). It provides a fluent API for assertions, unlike TestRestTemplate.
>
> It is recommended, but not mandatory, to use the Apache HTTP Client (version 4.3.2 or better). If you have that on your classpath, the TestRestTemplate responds by configuring the client appropriately. If you do use Apache's HTTP client, some additional test-friendly features are enabled:

-   Redirects are not followed (so you can assert the response location).

-   Cookies are ignored (so the template is stateless).

> TestRestTemplate can be instantiated directly in your integration tests, as shown in the following example:
>
> Alternatively, if you use the \@SpringBootTest annotation with WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT or WebEnvironment.DEFINED_PORT, you can inject a fully configured TestRestTemplate and start using it. If necessary, additional customizations can be applied through the RestTemplateBuilder bean. Any URLs that do not specify a host and port automatically connect to the embedded server, as shown in the following example:
>
> import java.time.Duration;
>
> import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
>
> import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired; import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
>
> import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment; import org.springframework.boot.test.context.TestConfiguration;

>
> }

## WebSockets

> Spring Boot provides WebSockets auto-configuration for embedded Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow. If you deploy a war file to a standalone container, Spring Boot assumes that the container is responsible for the configuration of its WebSocket support.
>
> Spring Framework provides rich WebSocket support for MVC web applications that can be easily accessed through the spring-boot-starter-websocket module.
>
> WebSocket support is also available for reactive web applications and requires to include the WebSocket API alongside spring-boot-starter-webflux:

## Web Services

> Spring Boot provides Web Services auto-configuration so that all you must do is define your
>
> Endpoints.
>
> The Spring Web Services features can be easily accessed with the spring-boot-starter-webservices
>
> module.
>
> SimpleWsdl11Definition and SimpleXsdSchema beans can be automatically created for your WSDLs and XSDs respectively. To do so, configure their location, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

### Calling Web Services with WebServiceTemplate

> If you need to call remote Web services from your application, you can use the WebServiceTemplate class. Since WebServiceTemplate instances often need to be customized before being used, Spring Boot does not provide any single auto-configured WebServiceTemplate bean. It does, however, auto- configure a WebServiceTemplateBuilder, which can be used to create WebServiceTemplate instances when needed.
>
> The following code shows a typical example:

#### import org.springframework.boot.webservices.client.WebServiceTemplateBuilder; import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

> import org.springframework.ws.client.core.WebServiceTemplate; import org.springframework.ws.soap.client.core.SoapActionCallback;
>
> \@Service
>
> public class MyService {
>
> private final WebServiceTemplate webServiceTemplate;
>
> public MyService(WebServiceTemplateBuilder webServiceTemplateBuilder) { this.webServiceTemplate = webServiceTemplateBuilder.build();
>
> }
>
> public SomeResponse someWsCall(SomeRequest detailsReq) { return (SomeResponse)
>
> this.webServiceTemplate.marshalSendAndReceive(detailsReq,
>
> new SoapActionCallback(\"https://ws.example.com/action\"));
>
> }
>
> }
>
> By default, WebServiceTemplateBuilder detects a suitable HTTP-based WebServiceMessageSender using the available HTTP client libraries on the classpath. You can also customize read and connection timeouts as follows:

#### import java.time.Duration;

> import org.springframework.boot.webservices.client.HttpWebServiceMessageSenderBuilder; import org.springframework.boot.webservices.client.WebServiceTemplateBuilder;
>
> import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
>
> import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration; import org.springframework.ws.client.core.WebServiceTemplate; import org.springframework.ws.transport.WebServiceMessageSender;
>
> \@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
>
> public class MyWebServiceTemplateConfiguration {
>
> \@Bean
>
> public WebServiceTemplate webServiceTemplate(WebServiceTemplateBuilder builder) { WebServiceMessageSender sender = new HttpWebServiceMessageSenderBuilder()
>
> .setConnectTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
>
> .setReadTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(2))
>
> .build();
>
> return builder.messageSenders(sender).build();
>
> }
>
> }

## Creating Your Own Auto-configuration

> If you work in a company that develops shared libraries, or if you work on an open-source or commercial library, you might want to develop your own auto-configuration. Auto-configuration classes can be bundled in external jars and still be picked-up by Spring Boot.
>
> Auto-configuration can be associated to a "starter" that provides the auto-configuration code as well as the typical libraries that you would use with it. We first cover what you need to know to build your own auto-configuration and then we move on to the [typical steps required to create a](\l) [custom starter](\l).
>
> **TIP** A demo project is available to showcase how you can create a starter step-by-step.

### Understanding Auto-configured Beans

> Under the hood, auto-configuration is implemented with standard \@Configuration classes. Additional \@Conditional annotations are used to constrain when the auto-configuration should apply. Usually, auto-configuration classes use \@ConditionalOnClass and \@ConditionalOnMissingBean annotations. This ensures that auto-configuration applies only when relevant classes are found and when you have not declared your own \@Configuration.
>
> You can browse the source code of spring-boot-autoconfigure to see the \@Configuration classes that Spring provides (see the META-INF/spring.factories file).

### Locating Auto-configuration Candidates

> Spring Boot checks for the presence of a META-INF/spring.factories file within your published jar. The file should list your configuration classes under the EnableAutoConfiguration key, as shown in the following example:

##### NOTE

> Auto-configurations must be loaded that way *only*. Make sure that they are defined in a specific package space and that they are never the target of component scanning. Furthermore, auto-configuration classes should not enable component scanning to find additional components. Specific \@Imports should be used instead.
>
> You can use the \@AutoConfigureAfter or \@AutoConfigureBefore annotations if your configuration needs to be applied in a specific order. For example, if you provide web-specific configuration, your class may need to be applied after WebMvcAutoConfiguration.
>
> If you want to order certain auto-configurations that should not have any direct knowledge of each other, you can also use \@AutoConfigureOrder. That annotation has the same semantic as the regular \@Order annotation but provides a dedicated order for auto-configuration classes.
>
> As with standard \@Configuration classes, the order in which auto-configuration classes are applied only affects the order in which their beans are defined. The order in which those beans are subsequently created is unaffected and is determined by each bean's dependencies and any \@DependsOn relationships.

### Condition Annotations

> You almost always want to include one or more \@Conditional annotations on your auto- configuration class. The \@ConditionalOnMissingBean annotation is one common example that is used to allow developers to override auto-configuration if they are not happy with your defaults.
>
> Spring Boot includes a number of \@Conditional annotations that you can reuse in your own code by annotating \@Configuration classes or individual \@Bean methods. These annotations include:

-   [Class Conditions](\l)

-   [Bean Conditions](\l)

-   [Property Conditions](\l)

-   [Resource Conditions](\l)

-   [Web Application Conditions](\l)

-   [SpEL Expression Conditions](\l)

##### Class Conditions

> The \@ConditionalOnClass and \@ConditionalOnMissingClass annotations let \@Configuration classes be included based on the presence or absence of specific classes. Due to the fact that annotation metadata is parsed by using ASM, you can use the value attribute to refer to the real class, even though that class might not actually appear on the running application classpath. You can also use the name attribute if you prefer to specify the class name by using a String value.
>
> This mechanism does not apply the same way to \@Bean methods where typically the return type is the target of the condition: before the condition on the method applies, the JVM will have loaded the class and potentially processed method references which will fail if the class is not present.
>
> To handle this scenario, a separate \@Configuration class can be used to isolate the condition, as shown in the following example:

##### TIP

> If you use \@ConditionalOnClass or \@ConditionalOnMissingClass as a part of a meta- annotation to compose your own composed annotations, you must use name as referring to the class in such a case is not handled.

##### Bean Conditions

> The \@ConditionalOnBean and \@ConditionalOnMissingBean annotations let a bean be included based on the presence or absence of specific beans. You can use the value attribute to specify beans by type or name to specify beans by name. The search attribute lets you limit the ApplicationContext hierarchy that should be considered when searching for beans.
>
> When placed on a \@Bean method, the target type defaults to the return type of the method, as shown in the following example:
>
> In the preceding example, the myService bean is going to be created if no bean of type MyService is already contained in the ApplicationContext.

##### TIP

> You need to be very careful about the order in which bean definitions are added, as these conditions are evaluated based on what has been processed so far. For this reason, we recommend using only \@ConditionalOnBean and \@ConditionalOnMissingBean annotations on auto-configuration classes (since these are guaranteed to load after any user-defined bean definitions have been added).

##### NOTE

> \@ConditionalOnBean and \@ConditionalOnMissingBean do not prevent \@Configuration classes from being created. The only difference between using these conditions at the class level and marking each contained \@Bean method with the annotation is that the former prevents registration of the \@Configuration class as a bean if the condition does not match.

##### TIP

> When declaring a \@Bean method, provide as much type information as possible in the method's return type. For example, if your bean's concrete class implements an interface the bean method's return type should be the concrete class and not the interface. Providing as much type information as possible in \@Bean methods is particularly important when using bean conditions as their evaluation can only rely upon to type information that's available in the method signature.

##### Property Conditions

> The \@ConditionalOnProperty annotation lets configuration be included based on a Spring Environment property. Use the prefix and name attributes to specify the property that should be checked. By default, any property that exists and is not equal to false is matched. You can also create more advanced checks by using the havingValue and matchIfMissing attributes.

##### Resource Conditions

> The \@ConditionalOnResource annotation lets configuration be included only when a specific resource
>
> is present. Resources can be specified by using the usual Spring conventions, as shown in the following example: file:/home/user/test.dat.

##### Web Application Conditions

> The \@ConditionalOnWebApplication and \@ConditionalOnNotWebApplication annotations let configuration be included depending on whether the application is a "web application". A servlet- based web application is any application that uses a Spring WebApplicationContext, defines a session scope, or has a ConfigurableWebEnvironment. A reactive web application is any application that uses a ReactiveWebApplicationContext, or has a ConfigurableReactiveWebEnvironment.
>
> The \@ConditionalOnWarDeployment annotation lets configuration be included depending on whether the application is a traditional WAR application that is deployed to a container. This condition will not match for applications that are run with an embedded server.

##### SpEL Expression Conditions

> The \@ConditionalOnExpression annotation lets configuration be included based on the result of a SpEL expression.

### Testing your Auto-configuration

> An auto-configuration can be affected by many factors: user configuration (\@Bean definition and Environment customization), condition evaluation (presence of a particular library), and others. Concretely, each test should create a well defined ApplicationContext that represents a combination of those customizations. ApplicationContextRunner provides a great way to achieve that.
>
> ApplicationContextRunner is usually defined as a field of the test class to gather the base, common configuration. The following example makes sure that MyServiceAutoConfiguration is always invoked:

##### TIP

> If multiple auto-configurations have to be defined, there is no need to order their declarations as they are invoked in the exact same order as when running the application.
>
> Each test can use the runner to represent a particular use case. For instance, the sample below invokes a user configuration (UserConfiguration) and checks that the auto-configuration backs off properly. Invoking run provides a callback context that can be used with AssertJ.
>
> It is also possible to easily customize the Environment, as shown in the following example:
>
> The runner can also be used to display the ConditionEvaluationReport. The report can be printed at INFO or DEBUG level. The following example shows how to use the ConditionEvaluationReportLoggingListener to print the report in auto-configuration tests.

##### Simulating a Web Context

> If you need to test an auto-configuration that only operates in a Servlet or Reactive web application context, use the WebApplicationContextRunner or ReactiveWebApplicationContextRunner respectively.

##### Overriding the Classpath

> It is also possible to test what happens when a particular class and/or package is not present at runtime. Spring Boot ships with a FilteredClassLoader that can easily be used by the runner. In the following example, we assert that if MyService is not present, the auto-configuration is properly disabled:

### Creating Your Own Starter

> A typical Spring Boot starter contains code to auto-configure and customize the infrastructure of a given technology, let's call that \"acme\". To make it easily extensible, a number of configuration keys in a dedicated namespace can be exposed to the environment. Finally, a single \"starter\" dependency is provided to help users get started as easily as possible.
>
> Concretely, a custom starter can contain the following:

-   The autoconfigure module that contains the auto-configuration code for \"acme\".

-   The starter module that provides a dependency to the autoconfigure module as well as \"acme\" and any additional dependencies that are typically useful. In a nutshell, adding the starter should provide everything needed to start using that library.

> This separation in two modules is in no way necessary. If \"acme\" has several flavors, options or optional features, then it is better to separate the auto-configuration as you can clearly express the fact some features are optional. Besides, you have the ability to craft a starter that provides an opinion about those optional dependencies. At the same time, others can rely only on the autoconfigure module and craft their own starter with different opinions.
>
> If the auto-configuration is relatively straightforward and does not have optional feature, merging the two modules in the starter is definitely an option.

##### Naming

> You should make sure to provide a proper namespace for your starter. Do not start your module names with spring-boot, even if you use a different Maven groupId. We may offer official support for the thing you auto-configure in the future.
>
> As a rule of thumb, you should name a combined module after the starter. For example, assume that you are creating a starter for \"acme\" and that you name the auto-configure module acme- spring-boot and the starter acme-spring-boot-starter. If you only have one module that combines the two, name it acme-spring-boot-starter.

##### Configuration keys

> If your starter provides configuration keys, use a unique namespace for them. In particular, do not include your keys in the namespaces that Spring Boot uses (such as server, management, spring, and so on). If you use the same namespace, we may modify these namespaces in the future in ways that break your modules. As a rule of thumb, prefix all your keys with a namespace that you own (e.g. acme).
>
> Make sure that configuration keys are documented by adding field javadoc for each property, as shown in the following example:

##### NOTE

> You should only use plain text with \@ConfigurationProperties field Javadoc, since they are not processed before being added to the JSON.
>
> Here are some rules we follow internally to make sure descriptions are consistent:

-   Do not start the description by \"The\" or \"A\".

-   For boolean types, start the description with \"Whether\" or \"Enable\".

-   For collection-based types, start the description with \"Comma-separated list\"

-   Use java.time.Duration rather than long and describe the default unit if it differs from milliseconds, e.g. \"If a duration suffix is not specified, seconds will be used\".

-   Do not provide the default value in the description unless it has to be determined at runtime.

> Make sure to [trigger meta-data generation](\l) so that IDE assistance is available for your keys as well. You may want to review the generated metadata (META-INF/spring-configuration-metadata.json) to make sure your keys are properly documented. Using your own starter in a compatible IDE is also a good idea to validate that quality of the metadata.

##### The "autoconfigure" Module

> The autoconfigure module contains everything that is necessary to get started with the library. It may also contain configuration key definitions (such as \@ConfigurationProperties) and any callback interface that can be used to further customize how the components are initialized.

##### TIP

> You should mark the dependencies to the library as optional so that you can include the autoconfigure module in your projects more easily. If you do it that way, the library is not provided and, by default, Spring Boot backs off.
>
> Spring Boot uses an annotation processor to collect the conditions on auto-configurations in a metadata file (META-INF/spring-autoconfigure-metadata.properties). If that file is present, it is used to eagerly filter auto-configurations that do not match, which will improve startup time. It is recommended to add the following dependency in a module that contains auto-configurations:
>
> If you have defined auto-configurations directly in your application, make sure to configure the
>
> spring-boot-maven-plugin to prevent the repackage goal from adding the dependency into the fat jar:
>
> With Gradle 4.5 and earlier, the dependency should be declared in the compileOnly configuration, as shown in the following example:
>
> With Gradle 4.6 and later, the dependency should be declared in the annotationProcessor
>
> configuration, as shown in the following example:

##### Starter Module

> The starter is really an empty jar. Its only purpose is to provide the necessary dependencies to work with the library. You can think of it as an opinionated view of what is required to get started.
>
> Do not make assumptions about the project in which your starter is added. If the library you are auto-configuring typically requires other starters, mention them as well. Providing a proper set of *default* dependencies may be hard if the number of optional dependencies is high, as you should avoid including dependencies that are unnecessary for a typical usage of the library. In other words, you should not include optional dependencies.

##### NOTE

> Either way, your starter must reference the core Spring Boot starter (spring-boot- starter) directly or indirectly (i.e. no need to add it if your starter relies on another starter). If a project is created with only your custom starter, Spring Boot's core features will be honoured by the presence of the core starter.

## Kotlin support

> Kotlin is a statically-typed language targeting the JVM (and other platforms) which allows writing concise and elegant code while providing interoperability with existing libraries written in Java.
>
> Spring Boot provides Kotlin support by leveraging the support in other Spring projects such as Spring Framework, Spring Data, and Reactor. See the Spring Framework Kotlin support documentation for more information.
>
> The easiest way to start with Spring Boot and Kotlin is to follow this comprehensive tutorial. You can create new Kotlin projects via start.spring.io. Feel free to join the #spring channel of Kotlin Slack or ask a question with the spring and kotlin tags on Stack Overflow if you need support.

### Requirements

> Spring Boot requires at least Kotlin 1.3.x and manages a suitable Kotlin version via dependency management. To use Kotlin, org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib and org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin- reflect must be present on the classpath. The kotlin-stdlib variants kotlin-stdlib-jdk7 and kotlin-stdlib-jdk8 can also be used.
>
> Since Kotlin classes are final by default, you are likely to want to configure kotlin-spring plugin in order to automatically open Spring-annotated classes so that they can be proxied.
>
> Jackson's Kotlin module is required for serializing / deserializing JSON data in Kotlin. It is automatically registered when found on the classpath. A warning message is logged if Jackson and Kotlin are present but the Jackson Kotlin module is not.
>
> **TIP** These dependencies and plugins are provided by default if one bootstraps a Kotlin project on start.spring.io.

### Null-safety

> One of Kotlin's key features is null-safety. It deals with null values at compile time rather than deferring the problem to runtime and encountering a NullPointerException. This helps to eliminate a common source of bugs without paying the cost of wrappers like Optional. Kotlin also allows using functional constructs with nullable values as described in this comprehensive guide to null-safety in Kotlin.
>
> Although Java does not allow one to express null-safety in its type system, Spring Framework, Spring Data, and Reactor now provide null-safety of their API via tooling-friendly annotations. By default, types from Java APIs used in Kotlin are recognized as platform types for which null-checks are relaxed. Kotlin's support for JSR 305 annotations combined with nullability annotations provide null-safety for the related Spring API in Kotlin.
>
> The JSR 305 checks can be configured by adding the -Xjsr305 compiler flag with the following options: -Xjsr305={strict\|warn\|ignore}. The default behavior is the same as -Xjsr305=warn. The strict value is required to have null-safety taken in account in Kotlin types inferred from Spring API but should be used with the knowledge that Spring API nullability declaration could evolve even between minor releases and more checks may be added in the future).

##### WARNING

> Generic type arguments, varargs and array elements nullability are not yet supported. See SPR-15942 for up-to-date information. Also be aware that Spring Boot's own API is not yet annotated.

### Kotlin API

##### runApplication

> Spring Boot provides an idiomatic way to run an application with
>
> runApplication\<MyApplication>(\*args) as shown in the following example:
>
> This is a drop-in replacement for SpringApplication.run(MyApplication::class.java, \*args). It also allows customization of the application as shown in the following example:

##### Extensions

> Kotlin extensions provide the ability to extend existing classes with additional functionality. The Spring Boot Kotlin API makes use of these extensions to add new Kotlin specific conveniences to existing APIs.
>
> TestRestTemplate extensions, similar to those provided by Spring Framework for RestOperations in Spring Framework, are provided. Among other things, the extensions make it possible to take advantage of Kotlin reified type parameters.

### Dependency management

> In order to avoid mixing different versions of Kotlin dependencies on the classpath, Spring Boot
>
> imports the Kotlin BOM.
>
> With Maven, the Kotlin version can be customized via the kotlin.version property and plugin management is provided for kotlin-maven-plugin. With Gradle, the Spring Boot plugin automatically aligns the kotlin.version with the version of the Kotlin plugin.
>
> Spring Boot also manages the version of Coroutines dependencies by importing the Kotlin Coroutines BOM. The version can be customized via the kotlin-coroutines.version property.

##### TIP

> org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-reactor dependency is provided by default if one bootstraps a Kotlin project with at least one reactive dependency on start.spring.io.

### \@ConfigurationProperties

> \@ConfigurationProperties when used in combination with [\@ConstructorBinding](\l) supports classes with immutable val properties as shown in the following example:

##### TIP

> To generate [your own metadata](\l) using the annotation processor, kapt should be configured with the spring-boot-configuration-processor dependency. Note that some features (such as detecting the default value or deprecated items) are not working due to limitations in the model kapt provides.

### Testing

> While it is possible to use JUnit 4 to test Kotlin code, JUnit 5 is provided by default and is recommended. JUnit 5 enables a test class to be instantiated once and reused for all of the class's tests. This makes it possible to use \@BeforeAll and \@AfterAll annotations on non-static methods, which is a good fit for Kotlin.
>
> To mock Kotlin classes, MockK is recommended. If you need the Mockk equivalent of the Mockito specific [\@MockBean](\l) [and](\l) [\@SpyBean](\l) [annotations](\l), you can use SpringMockK which provides similar \@MockkBean and \@SpykBean annotations.

    1.  ## Container Images

> It is easily possible to package a Spring Boot fat jar as a docker image. However, there are various downsides to copying and running the fat jar as is in the docker image. There's always a certain amount of overhead when running a fat jar without unpacking it, and in a containerized environment this can be noticeable. The other issue is that putting your application's code and all its dependencies in one layer in the Docker image is sub-optimal. Since you probably recompile your code more often than you upgrade the version of Spring Boot you use, it's often better to separate things a bit more. If you put jar files in the layer before your application classes, Docker often only needs to change the very bottom layer and can pick others up from its cache.

### Layering Docker Images

> To make it easier to create optimized Docker images, Spring Boot supports adding a layer index file to the jar. It provides a list of layers and the parts of the jar that should be contained within them. The list of layers in the index is ordered based on the order in which the layers should be added to
>
> the Docker/OCI image. Out-of-the-box, the following layers are supported:

-   dependencies (for regular released dependencies)

-   spring-boot-loader (for everything under org/springframework/boot/loader)

-   snapshot-dependencies (for snapshot dependencies)

-   application (for application classes and resources) The following shows an example of a layers.idx file:

> This layering is designed to separate code based on how likely it is to change between application builds. Library code is less likely to change between builds, so it is placed in its own layers to allow tooling to re-use the layers from cache. Application code is more likely to change between builds so it is isolated in a separate layer.
>
> Spring Boot also supports layering for war files with the help of a layers.idx.
>
> For Maven, refer to the packaging layered jar or war section for more details on adding a layer index to the archive. For Gradle, refer to the packaging layered jar or war section of the Gradle plugin documentation.

### Building Container Images

> Spring Boot applications can be containerized [using Dockerfiles](\l), or by [using Cloud Native](\l) [Buildpacks to create docker compatible container images that you can run anywhere](\l).

##### Dockerfiles

> While it is possible to convert a Spring Boot fat jar into a docker image with just a few lines in the Dockerfile, we will use the [layering feature](\l) to create an optimized docker image. When you create a jar containing the layers index file, the spring-boot-jarmode-layertools jar will be added as a dependency to your jar. With this jar on the classpath, you can launch your application in a special mode which allows the bootstrap code to run something entirely different from your application, for example, something that extracts the layers.

##### CAUTION

> The layertools mode can not be used with a [fully executable Spring Boot](\l) [archive](\l) that includes a launch script. Disable launch script configuration when building a jar file that is intended to be used with layertools.
>
> Here's how you can launch your jar with a layertools jar mode:
>
> This will provide the following output:
>
> The extract command can be used to easily split the application into layers to be added to the dockerfile. Here's an example of a Dockerfile using jarmode.
>
> Assuming the above Dockerfile is in the current directory, your docker image can be built with docker build ., or optionally specifying the path to your application jar, as shown in the following example:
>
> This is a multi-stage dockerfile. The builder stage extracts the directories that are needed later. Each of the COPY commands relates to the layers extracted by the jarmode.
>
> Of course, a Dockerfile can be written without using the jarmode. You can use some combination of
>
> unzip and mv to move things to the right layer but jarmode simplifies that.

##### Cloud Native Buildpacks

> Dockerfiles are just one way to build docker images. Another way to build docker images is directly from your Maven or Gradle plugin, using buildpacks. If you've ever used an application platform such as Cloud Foundry or Heroku then you've probably used a buildpack. Buildpacks are the part of the platform that takes your application and converts it into something that the platform can actually run. For example, Cloud Foundry's Java buildpack will notice that you're pushing a .jar file and automatically add a relevant JRE.
>
> With Cloud Native Buildpacks, you can create Docker compatible images that you can run anywhere. Spring Boot includes buildpack support directly for both Maven and Gradle. This means you can just type a single command and quickly get a sensible image into your locally running Docker daemon.
>
> Refer to the individual plugin documentation on how to use buildpacks with Maven and Gradle.

##### NOTE

> The Paketo Spring Boot buildpack has also been updated to support the layers.idx file so any customization that is applied to it will be reflected in the image created by the buildpack.

##### NOTE

> In order to achieve reproducible builds and container image caching, Buildpacks can manipulate the application resources metadata (such as the file \"last modified\" information). You should ensure that your application does not rely on that metadata at runtime. Spring Boot can use that information when serving static
>
> resources, but this can be disabled with spring.web.resources.cache.use-last- modified

## What to Read Next

> If you want to learn more about any of the classes discussed in this section, you can check out the Spring Boot API documentation or you can browse the source code directly. If you have specific questions, take a look at the [how-to](\l) section.
>
> If you are comfortable with Spring Boot's core features, you can continue on and read about [production-ready features](\l).

# Chapter 8. Spring Boot Actuator: Production- ready Features

> Spring Boot includes a number of additional features to help you monitor and manage your application when you push it to production. You can choose to manage and monitor your application by using HTTP endpoints or with JMX. Auditing, health, and metrics gathering can also be automatically applied to your application.

## Enabling Production-ready Features

> The spring-boot-actuator module provides all of Spring Boot's production-ready features. The recommended way to enable the features is to add a dependency on the spring-boot-starter- actuator 'Starter'.
>
> To add the actuator to a Maven based project, add the following 'Starter' dependency:
>
> For Gradle, use the following declaration:

## Endpoints

> Actuator endpoints let you monitor and interact with your application. Spring Boot includes a number of built-in endpoints and lets you add your own. For example, the health endpoint provides basic application health information.
>
> Each individual endpoint can be [enabled or disabled](\l) and [exposed (made remotely accessible) over](\l) [HTTP or JMX](\l). An endpoint is considered to be available when it is both enabled and exposed. The built-in endpoints will only be auto-configured when they are available. Most applications choose
>
> exposure via HTTP, where the ID of the endpoint along with a prefix of /actuator is mapped to a URL. For example, by default, the health endpoint is mapped to /actuator/health.
>
> **TIP** To learn more about the Actuator's endpoints and their request and response formats, please refer to the separate API documentation (HTML or PDF).
>
> The following technology-agnostic endpoints are available:

### Enabling Endpoints

> By default, all endpoints except for shutdown are enabled. To configure the enablement of an endpoint, use its management.endpoint.\<id>.enabled property. The following example enables the shutdown endpoint:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> If you prefer endpoint enablement to be opt-in rather than opt-out, set the management.endpoints.enabled-by-default property to false and use individual endpoint enabled properties to opt back in. The following example enables the info endpoint and disables all other endpoints:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### NOTE

> Disabled endpoints are removed entirely from the application context. If you want to change only the technologies over which an endpoint is exposed, use the [include](\l) [and](\l) [exclude](\l) [properties](\l) instead.

### Exposing Endpoints

> Since Endpoints may contain sensitive information, careful consideration should be given about when to expose them. The following table shows the default exposure for the built-in endpoints:

> The include property lists the IDs of the endpoints that are exposed. The exclude property lists the IDs of the endpoints that should not be exposed. The exclude property takes precedence over the include property. Both include and exclude properties can be configured with a list of endpoint IDs.
>
> For example, to stop exposing all endpoints over JMX and only expose the health and info
>
> endpoints, use the following property:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> \* can be used to select all endpoints. For example, to expose everything over HTTP except the env
>
> and beans endpoints, use the following properties:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### NOTE

> **NOTE**
>
> \* has a special meaning in YAML, so be sure to add quotes if you want to include (or exclude) all endpoints.
>
> If your application is exposed publicly, we strongly recommend that you also [secure](\l) [your endpoints](\l).

##### TIP

> If you want to implement your own strategy for when endpoints are exposed, you can register an EndpointFilter bean.

### Securing HTTP Endpoints

> You should take care to secure HTTP endpoints in the same way that you would any other sensitive URL. If Spring Security is present, endpoints are secured by default using Spring Security's content- negotiation strategy. If you wish to configure custom security for HTTP endpoints, for example, only allow users with a certain role to access them, Spring Boot provides some convenient RequestMatcher objects that can be used in combination with Spring Security.
>
> A typical Spring Security configuration might look something like the following example:

#### import org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.security.servlet.EndpointRequest; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;

> import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
>
> import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity; import org.springframework.security.web.SecurityFilterChain;
>
> \@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false) public class MySecurityConfiguration {
>
> \@Bean
>
> public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception
>
> {
>
> http.requestMatcher(EndpointRequest.toAnyEndpoint())
>
> .authorizeRequests((requests) -\>
>
> requests.anyRequest().hasRole(\"ENDPOINT_ADMIN\")); http.httpBasic();
>
> return http.build();
>
> }
>
> }
>
> The preceding example uses EndpointRequest.toAnyEndpoint() to match a request to any endpoint and then ensures that all have the ENDPOINT_ADMIN role. Several other matcher methods are also available on EndpointRequest. See the API documentation (HTML or PDF) for details.
>
> If you deploy applications behind a firewall, you may prefer that all your actuator endpoints can be accessed without requiring authentication. You can do so by changing the management.endpoints.web.exposure.include property, as follows:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> Additionally, if Spring Security is present, you would need to add custom security configuration that allows unauthenticated access to the endpoints as shown in the following example:

#### import org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.security.servlet.EndpointRequest; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;

> import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
>
> import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity; import org.springframework.security.web.SecurityFilterChain;
>
> \@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false) public class MySecurityConfiguration {
>
> \@Bean
>
> public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception
>
> {
>
> http.requestMatcher(EndpointRequest.toAnyEndpoint())
>
> .authorizeRequests((requests) -\> requests.anyRequest().permitAll()); return http.build();
>
> }
>
> }

##### NOTE

> In both the examples above, the configuration applies only to the actuator endpoints. Since Spring Boot's security configuration backs off completely in the presence of any SecurityFilterChain bean, you will need to configure an additional SecurityFilterChain bean with rules that apply to the rest of the application.

### Configuring Endpoints

> Endpoints automatically cache responses to read operations that do not take any parameters. To configure the amount of time for which an endpoint will cache a response, use its cache.time-to- live property. The following example sets the time-to-live of the beans endpoint's cache to 10 seconds:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### NOTE

> The prefix management.endpoint.\<name> is used to uniquely identify the endpoint that is being configured.

### Hypermedia for Actuator Web Endpoints

> A "discovery page" is added with links to all the endpoints. The "discovery page" is available on
>
> /actuator by default.
>
> To disable the "discovery page", add the following property to your application properties:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> When a custom management context path is configured, the "discovery page" automatically moves from /actuator to the root of the management context. For example, if the management context path is /management, then the discovery page is available from /management. When the management context path is set to /, the discovery page is disabled to prevent the possibility of a clash with other mappings.

### CORS Support

> Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a W3C specification that lets you specify in a flexible way what kind of cross-domain requests are authorized. If you use Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux, Actuator's web endpoints can be configured to support such scenarios.
>
> CORS support is disabled by default and is only enabled once the management.endpoints.web.cors.allowed-origins property has been set. The following configuration permits GET and POST calls from the example.com domain:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> **TIP** See CorsEndpointProperties for a complete list of options.

### Implementing Custom Endpoints

> If you add a \@Bean annotated with \@Endpoint, any methods annotated with \@ReadOperation, \@WriteOperation, or \@DeleteOperation are automatically exposed over JMX and, in a web application, over HTTP as well. Endpoints can be exposed over HTTP using Jersey, Spring MVC, or Spring WebFlux. If both Jersey and Spring MVC are available, Spring MVC will be used.
>
> The following example exposes a read operation that returns a custom object:
>
> You can also write technology-specific endpoints by using \@JmxEndpoint or \@WebEndpoint. These endpoints are restricted to their respective technologies. For example, \@WebEndpoint is exposed only over HTTP and not over JMX.
>
> You can write technology-specific extensions by using \@EndpointWebExtension and \@EndpointJmxExtension. These annotations let you provide technology-specific operations to augment an existing endpoint.
>
> Finally, if you need access to web-framework-specific functionality, you can implement Servlet or Spring \@Controller and \@RestController endpoints at the cost of them not being available over JMX or when using a different web framework.

##### Receiving Input

> Operations on an endpoint receive input via their parameters. When exposed via the web, the values for these parameters are taken from the URL's query parameters and from the JSON request body. When exposed via JMX, the parameters are mapped to the parameters of the MBean's operations. Parameters are required by default. They can be made optional by annotating them with either \@javax.annotation.Nullable or \@org.springframework.lang.Nullable.
>
> Each root property in the JSON request body can be mapped to a parameter of the endpoint. Consider the following JSON request body:
>
> This can be used to invoke a write operation that takes String name and int counter parameters, as shown in the following example:

##### TIP

> Because endpoints are technology agnostic, only simple types can be specified in the method signature. In particular declaring a single parameter with a CustomData type defining a name and counter properties is not supported.

##### NOTE

> To allow the input to be mapped to the operation method's parameters, Java code implementing an endpoint should be compiled with -parameters, and Kotlin code implementing an endpoint should be compiled with -java-parameters. This will happen automatically if you are using Spring Boot's Gradle plugin or if you are using Maven and spring-boot-starter-parent.
>
> **Input Type Conversion**
>
> The parameters passed to endpoint operation methods are, if necessary, automatically converted to the required type. Before calling an operation method, the input received via JMX or an HTTP request is converted to the required types using an instance of ApplicationConversionService as well as any Converter or GenericConverter beans qualified with \@EndpointConverter.

##### Custom Web Endpoints

> Operations on an \@Endpoint, \@WebEndpoint, or \@EndpointWebExtension are automatically exposed over HTTP using Jersey, Spring MVC, or Spring WebFlux. If both Jersey and Spring MVC are available, Spring MVC will be used.
>
> **Web Endpoint Request Predicates**
>
> A request predicate is automatically generated for each operation on a web-exposed endpoint.
>
> **Path**
>
> The path of the predicate is determined by the ID of the endpoint and the base path of web-exposed endpoints. The default base path is /actuator. For example, an endpoint with the ID sessions will use /actuator/sessions as its path in the predicate.
>
> The path can be further customized by annotating one or more parameters of the operation method with \@Selector. Such a parameter is added to the path predicate as a path variable. The variable's value is passed into the operation method when the endpoint operation is invoked. If you want to capture all remaining path elements, you can add \@Selector(Match=ALL_REMAINING) to the last parameter and make it a type that is conversion compatible with a String\[\].
>
> **HTTP method**
>
> The HTTP method of the predicate is determined by the operation type, as shown in the following table:

+-----------------------------------------------------+-------------------+
| **Operation**                                       | > **HTTP method** |
+-----------------------------------------------------+-------------------+
| \@ReadOperation                                     | > GET             |
+-----------------------------------------------------+-------------------+
| \@WriteOperation                                    | > POST            |
+-----------------------------------------------------+-------------------+
| \@DeleteOperation                                   | > DELETE          |
+-----------------------------------------------------+-------------------+

> **Consumes**
>
> For a \@WriteOperation (HTTP POST) that uses the request body, the consumes clause of the predicate is application/vnd.spring-boot.actuator.v2+json, application/json. For all other operations the consumes clause is empty.
>
> **Produces**
>
> The produces clause of the predicate can be determined by the produces attribute of the \@DeleteOperation, \@ReadOperation, and \@WriteOperation annotations. The attribute is optional. If it is not used, the produces clause is determined automatically.
>
> If the operation method returns void or Void the produces clause is empty. If the operation method returns a org.springframework.core.io.Resource, the produces clause is application/octet-stream. For all other operations the produces clause is application/vnd.spring-boot.actuator.v2+json, application/json.
>
> **Web Endpoint Response Status**
>
> The default response status for an endpoint operation depends on the operation type (read, write, or delete) and what, if anything, the operation returns.
>
> A \@ReadOperation returns a value, the response status will be 200 (OK). If it does not return a value, the response status will be 404 (Not Found).
>
> If a \@WriteOperation or \@DeleteOperation returns a value, the response status will be 200 (OK). If it does not return a value the response status will be 204 (No Content).
>
> If an operation is invoked without a required parameter, or with a parameter that cannot be converted to the required type, the operation method will not be called and the response status will be 400 (Bad Request).
>
> **Web Endpoint Range Requests**
>
> An HTTP range request can be used to request part of an HTTP resource. When using Spring MVC or Spring Web Flux, operations that return a org.springframework.core.io.Resource automatically support range requests.
>
> **NOTE** Range requests are not supported when using Jersey.
>
> **Web Endpoint Security**
>
> An operation on a web endpoint or a web-specific endpoint extension can receive the current java.security.Principal or org.springframework.boot.actuate.endpoint.SecurityContext as a method parameter. The former is typically used in conjunction with \@Nullable to provide different
>
> behavior for authenticated and unauthenticated users. The latter is typically used to perform authorization checks using its isUserInRole(String) method.

##### Servlet Endpoints

> A Servlet can be exposed as an endpoint by implementing a class annotated with \@ServletEndpoint that also implements Supplier\<EndpointServlet>. Servlet endpoints provide deeper integration with the Servlet container but at the expense of portability. They are intended to be used to expose an existing Servlet as an endpoint. For new endpoints, the \@Endpoint and \@WebEndpoint annotations should be preferred whenever possible.

##### Controller Endpoints

> \@ControllerEndpoint and \@RestControllerEndpoint can be used to implement an endpoint that is only exposed by Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux. Methods are mapped using the standard annotations for Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux such as \@RequestMapping and \@GetMapping, with the endpoint's ID being used as a prefix for the path. Controller endpoints provide deeper integration with Spring's web frameworks but at the expense of portability. The \@Endpoint and \@WebEndpoint annotations should be preferred whenever possible.

### Health Information

> You can use health information to check the status of your running application. It is often used by monitoring software to alert someone when a production system goes down. The information exposed by the health endpoint depends on the management.endpoint.health.show-details and management.endpoint.health.show-components properties which can be configured with one of the following values:

----------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Name**          **Description**

  never             Details are never shown.

  when-authorized   Details are only shown to authorized users. Authorized roles can be configured using management.endpoint.health.roles.

  always            Details are shown to all users.
----------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> The default value is never. A user is considered to be authorized when they are in one or more of the endpoint's roles. If the endpoint has no configured roles (the default) all authenticated users are considered to be authorized. The roles can be configured using the management.endpoint.health.roles property.

##### NOTE

> If you have secured your application and wish to use always, your security configuration must permit access to the health endpoint for both authenticated and unauthenticated users.
>
> Health information is collected from the content of a HealthContributorRegistry (by default all HealthContributor instances defined in your ApplicationContext). Spring Boot includes a number of auto-configured HealthContributors and you can also write your own.
>
> A HealthContributor can either be a HealthIndicator or a CompositeHealthContributor. A
>
> HealthIndicator provides actual health information, including a Status. A CompositeHealthContributor provides a composite of other HealthContributors. Taken together, contributors form a tree structure to represent the overall system health.
>
> By default, the final system health is derived by a StatusAggregator which sorts the statuses from each HealthIndicator based on an ordered list of statuses. The first status in the sorted list is used as the overall health status. If no HealthIndicator returns a status that is known to the StatusAggregator, an UNKNOWN status is used.
>
> **TIP** The HealthContributorRegistry can be used to register and unregister health indicators at runtime.

##### Auto-configured HealthIndicators

> The following HealthIndicators are auto-configured by Spring Boot when appropriate. You can also enable/disable selected indicators by configuring management.health.key.enabled, with the key listed in the table below.

+---------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| **Key**       | > **Name**                          | > **Description**                                         |

>
> Additional HealthIndicators are available but not enabled by default:

---------------- -------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**          **Name**                         **Description**

  livenessstate    LivenessStateHealthIndicator     Exposes the \"Liveness\" application availability state.

  readinessstate   ReadinessStateHealthIndicato r   Exposes the \"Readiness\" application availability state.
---------------- -------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------

##### Writing Custom HealthIndicators

> To provide custom health information, you can register Spring beans that implement the HealthIndicator interface. You need to provide an implementation of the health() method and return a Health response. The Health response should include a status and can optionally include additional details to be displayed. The following code shows a sample HealthIndicator implementation:

##### NOTE

> The identifier for a given HealthIndicator is the name of the bean without the HealthIndicator suffix, if it exists. In the preceding example, the health information is available in an entry named my.
>
> In addition to Spring Boot's predefined Status types, it is also possible for Health to return a custom Status that represents a new system state. In such cases, a custom implementation of the StatusAggregator interface also needs to be provided, or the default implementation has to be configured by using the management.endpoint.health.status.order configuration property.
>
> For example, assume a new Status with code FATAL is being used in one of your HealthIndicator
>
> implementations. To configure the severity order, add the following property to your application properties:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> The HTTP status code in the response reflects the overall health status. By default, OUT_OF_SERVICE and DOWN map to 503. Any unmapped health statuses, including UP, map to 200. You might also want to register custom status mappings if you access the health endpoint over HTTP. Configuring a custom mapping disables the defaults mappings for DOWN and OUT_OF_SERVICE. If you want to retain the default mappings they must be configured explicitly alongside any custom mappings. For example, the following property maps FATAL to 503 (service unavailable) and retains the default mappings for DOWN and OUT_OF_SERVICE:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> **TIP** If you need more control, you can define your own HttpCodeStatusMapper bean.
>
> The following table shows the default status mappings for the built-in statuses:

----------------- -----------------------------------------------------
  **Status**        **Mapping**

  DOWN              SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE (503)

  OUT_OF_SERVICE    SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE (503)
----------------- -----------------------------------------------------

----------------- -----------------------------------------------------
  **Status**        **Mapping**

  UP                No mapping by default, so HTTP status is 200

  UNKNOWN           No mapping by default, so HTTP status is 200
----------------- -----------------------------------------------------

##### Reactive Health Indicators

> For reactive applications, such as those using Spring WebFlux, ReactiveHealthContributor provides a non-blocking contract for getting application health. Similar to a traditional HealthContributor, health information is collected from the content of a ReactiveHealthContributorRegistry (by default all HealthContributor and ReactiveHealthContributor instances defined in your ApplicationContext). Regular HealthContributors that do not check against a reactive API are executed on the elastic scheduler.

##### TIP

> In a reactive application, The ReactiveHealthContributorRegistry should be used to register and unregister health indicators at runtime. If you need to register a regular HealthContributor, you should wrap it using ReactiveHealthContributor#adapt.
>
> To provide custom health information from a reactive API, you can register Spring beans that implement the ReactiveHealthIndicator interface. The following code shows a sample ReactiveHealthIndicator implementation:

##### TIP

> To handle the error automatically, consider extending from
>
> AbstractReactiveHealthIndicator.

##### Auto-configured ReactiveHealthIndicators

> The following ReactiveHealthIndicators are auto-configured by Spring Boot when appropriate:

+---------------+-------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| **Key**       | > **Name**                                | > **Description**                             |
+---------------+-------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| cassandra     | > CassandraDriverReactiveHealthI ndicator | > Checks that a Cassandra database is up.     |
+---------------+-------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| couchbase     | > CouchbaseReactiveHealthIndicat or       | > Checks that a Couchbase cluster is up.      |
+---------------+-------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| elasticsearch | > ElasticsearchReactiveHealthInd icator   | > Checks that an Elasticsearch cluster is up. |
+---------------+-------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| mongo         | > MongoReactiveHealthIndicator            | > Checks that a Mongo database is up.         |
+---------------+-------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| neo4j         | > Neo4jReactiveHealthIndicator            | > Checks that a Neo4j database is up.         |
+---------------+-------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| redis         | > RedisReactiveHealthIndicator            | > Checks that a Redis server is up.           |
+---------------+-------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+

##### TIP

> If necessary, reactive indicators replace the regular ones. Also, any HealthIndicator
>
> that is not handled explicitly is wrapped automatically.

##### Health Groups

> It's sometimes useful to organize health indicators into groups that can be used for different purposes.
>
> To create a health indicator group you can use the management.endpoint.health.group.\<name> property and specify a list of health indicator IDs to include or exclude. For example, to create a group that includes only database indicators you can define the following:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> You can then check the result by hitting localhost:8080/actuator/health/custom.
>
> Similarly, to create a group that excludes the database indicators from the group and includes all the other indicators, you can define the following:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> By default groups will inherit the same StatusAggregator and HttpCodeStatusMapper settings as the system health, however, these can also be defined on a per-group basis. It's also possible to override the show-details and roles properties if required:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### TIP

> You can use \@Qualifier(\"groupname\") if you need to register custom StatusAggregator
>
> or HttpCodeStatusMapper beans for use with the group.

##### DataSource Health

> The DataSource health indicator shows the health of both standard data source and routing data source beans. The health of a routing data source includes the health of each of its target data sources. In the health endpoint's response, each of a routing data source's targets is named using its
>
> routing key. If you prefer not to include routing data sources in the indicator's output, set
>
> management.health.db.ignore-routing-data-sources to true.

### Kubernetes Probes

> Applications deployed on Kubernetes can provide information about their internal state with Container Probes. Depending on your Kubernetes configuration, the kubelet will call those probes and react to the result.
>
> Spring Boot manages your [Application Availability State](\l) out-of-the-box. If deployed in a Kubernetes environment, actuator will gather the \"Liveness\" and \"Readiness\" information from the ApplicationAvailability interface and use that information in dedicated [Health Indicators](\l): LivenessStateHealthIndicator and ReadinessStateHealthIndicator. These indicators will be shown on the global health endpoint (\"/actuator/health\"). They will also be exposed as separate HTTP Probes using [Health Groups](\l): \"/actuator/health/liveness\" and \"/actuator/health/readiness\".
>
> You can then configure your Kubernetes infrastructure with the following endpoint information:

##### NOTE

> \<actuator-port> should be set to the port that the actuator endpoints are available on. It could be the main web server port, or a separate management port if the \"management.server.port\" property has been set.
>
> These health groups are only enabled automatically if the application is [running in a Kubernetes](\l) [environment](\l). You can enable them in any environment using the management.endpoint.health.probes.enabled configuration property.

##### NOTE

> If an application takes longer to start than the configured liveness period, Kubernetes mention the \"startupProbe\" as a possible solution. The \"startupProbe\" is not necessarily needed here as the \"readinessProbe\" fails until all startup tasks are done, see [how Probes behave during the application lifecycle](\l).

##### WARNING

> If your Actuator endpoints are deployed on a separate management context, be aware that endpoints are then not using the same web infrastructure (port, connection pools, framework components) as the main application. In this case, a probe check could be successful even if the main application does not work properly (for example, it cannot accept new connections).

##### Checking External State with Kubernetes Probes

> Actuator configures the \"liveness\" and \"readiness\" probes as Health Groups; this means that all the [Health Groups features](\l) are available for them. You can, for example, configure additional Health Indicators:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> By default, Spring Boot does not add other Health Indicators to these groups.
>
> The "liveness" Probe should not depend on health checks for external systems. If the [Liveness State](\l) [of an application](\l) is broken, Kubernetes will try to solve that problem by restarting the application instance. This means that if an external system fails (e.g. a database, a Web API, an external cache), Kubernetes might restart all application instances and create cascading failures.

> As for the "readiness" Probe, the choice of checking external systems must be made carefully by the application developers, i.e. Spring Boot does not include any additional health checks in the readiness probe. If the [Readiness State of an application instance](\l) is unready, Kubernetes will not route traffic to that instance. Some external systems might not be shared by application instances, in which case they could quite naturally be included in a readiness probe. Other external systems might not be essential to the application (the application could have circuit breakers and fallbacks), in which case they definitely should not be included. Unfortunately, an external system that is shared by all application instances is common, and you have to make a judgement call: include it in the readiness probe and expect that the application is taken out of service when the external service is down, or leave it out and deal with failures higher up the stack, e.g. using a circuit breaker in the caller.

##### NOTE

> If all instances of an application are unready, a Kubernetes Service with type=ClusterIP or NodePort will not accept any incoming connections. There is no HTTP error response (503 etc.) since there is no connection. A Service with type=LoadBalancer might or might not accept connections, depending on the provider. A Service that has an explicit Ingress will also respond in a way that depends on the implementation - the ingress service itself will have to decide how to handle the \"connection refused\" from downstream. HTTP 503 is quite likely in the case of both load balancer and ingress.
>
> Also, if an application is using Kubernetes autoscaling it may react differently to applications being taken out of the load-balancer, depending on its autoscaler configuration.

##### Application Lifecycle and Probe States

> An important aspect of the Kubernetes Probes support is its consistency with the application lifecycle. There is a significant difference between the AvailabilityState which is the in-memory, internal state of the application and the actual Probe which exposes that state: depending on the phase of application lifecycle, the Probe might not be available.
>
> Spring Boot publishes [Application Events during startup and shutdown](\l), and Probes can listen to such events and expose the AvailabilityState information.
>
> The following tables show the AvailabilityState and the state of HTTP connectors at different stages.
>
> When a Spring Boot application starts:

##### TIP

> Check out the [Kubernetes container lifecycle section](\l) for more information about Kubernetes deployment.

### Application Information

> Application information exposes various information collected from all InfoContributor beans defined in your ApplicationContext. Spring Boot includes a number of auto-configured InfoContributor beans, and you can write your own.

##### Auto-configured InfoContributors

> The following InfoContributor beans are auto-configured by Spring Boot, when appropriate:

----------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Name**                      **Description**

  EnvironmentInfoCon tributor   Exposes any key from the Environment under the info key.

  GitInfoContributor            Exposes git information if a git.properties file is available.

  BuildInfoContribut or         Exposes build information if a META-INF/build-info.properties file is available.
----------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### TIP

> It is possible to disable them all by setting the management.info.defaults.enabled
>
> property.

##### Custom Application Information

> You can customize the data exposed by the info endpoint by setting info.\* Spring properties. All Environment properties under the info key are automatically exposed. For example, you could add the following settings to your application.properties file:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> Rather than hardcoding those values, you could also [expand info properties at build](\l) [time](\l).
>
> Assuming you use Maven, you could rewrite the preceding example as follows:
>
> *Properties*

##### TIP

> *Yaml*

##### Git Commit Information

> Another useful feature of the info endpoint is its ability to publish information about the state of your git source code repository when the project was built. If a GitProperties bean is available, the info endpoint can be used to expose these properties.
>
> **TIP** A GitProperties bean is auto-configured if a git.properties file is available at the root of the classpath. See \"[Generate git information](\l)\" for more details.
>
> By default, the endpoint exposes git.branch, git.commit.id, and git.commit.time properties, if present. If you don't want any of these properties in the endpoint response, they need to be excluded from the git.properties file. If you want to display the full git information (that is, the full content of git.properties), use the management.info.git.mode property, as follows:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> To disable the git commit information from the info endpoint completely, set the
>
> management.info.git.enabled property to false, as follows:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### Build Information

> If a BuildProperties bean is available, the info endpoint can also publish information about your build. This happens if a META-INF/build-info.properties file is available in the classpath.
>
> **TIP** The Maven and Gradle plugins can both generate that file. See \"[Generate build](\l) [information](\l)\" for more details.

##### Writing Custom InfoContributors

> To provide custom application information, you can register Spring beans that implement the
>
> InfoContributor interface.
>
> The following example contributes an example entry with a single value:
>
> If you reach the info endpoint, you should see a response that contains the following additional entry:

## Monitoring and Management over HTTP

> If you are developing a web application, Spring Boot Actuator auto-configures all enabled endpoints to be exposed over HTTP. The default convention is to use the id of the endpoint with a prefix of /actuator as the URL path. For example, health is exposed as /actuator/health.
>
> **TIP** Actuator is supported natively with Spring MVC, Spring WebFlux, and Jersey. If both Jersey and Spring MVC are available, Spring MVC will be used.
>
> **NOTE** Jackson is a required dependency in order to get the correct JSON responses as documented in the API documentation (HTML or PDF).

### Customizing the Management Endpoint Paths

> Sometimes, it is useful to customize the prefix for the management endpoints. For example, your application might already use /actuator for another purpose. You can use the management.endpoints.web.base-path property to change the prefix for your management endpoint, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> The preceding application.properties example changes the endpoint from /actuator/{id} to
>
> /manage/{id} (for example, /manage/info).

##### NOTE

> Unless the management port has been configured to [expose endpoints by using a](\l) [different HTTP port](\l), management.endpoints.web.base-path is relative to server.servlet.context-path (Servlet web applications) or spring.webflux.base-path (reactive web applications). If management.server.port is configured, management.endpoints.web.base-path is relative to management.server.base-path.
>
> If you want to map endpoints to a different path, you can use the management.endpoints.web.path- mapping property.
>
> The following example remaps /actuator/health to /healthcheck:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

### Customizing the Management Server Port

> Exposing management endpoints by using the default HTTP port is a sensible choice for cloud- based deployments. If, however, your application runs inside your own data center, you may prefer to expose endpoints by using a different HTTP port.
>
> You can set the management.server.port property to change the HTTP port, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### NOTE

> On Cloud Foundry, applications only receive requests on port 8080 for both HTTP and TCP routing, by default. If you want to use a custom management port on Cloud Foundry, you will need to explicitly set up the application's routes to forward traffic to the custom port.

### Configuring Management-specific SSL

> When configured to use a custom port, the management server can also be configured with its own SSL by using the various management.server.ssl.\* properties. For example, doing so lets a management server be available over HTTP while the main application uses HTTPS, as shown in the following property settings:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> Alternatively, both the main server and the management server can use SSL but with different key stores, as follows:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

### Customizing the Management Server Address

> You can customize the address that the management endpoints are available on by setting the management.server.address property. Doing so can be useful if you want to listen only on an internal or ops-facing network or to listen only for connections from localhost.
>
> **NOTE** You can listen on a different address only when the port differs from the main server port.
>
> The following example application.properties does not allow remote management connections:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

### Disabling HTTP Endpoints

> If you do not want to expose endpoints over HTTP, you can set the management port to -1, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> This can be achieved using the management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude property as well, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

## Monitoring and Management over JMX

> Java Management Extensions (JMX) provide a standard mechanism to monitor and manage applications. By default, this feature is not enabled and can be turned on by setting the configuration property spring.jmx.enabled to true. Spring Boot exposes management endpoints as JMX MBeans under the org.springframework.boot domain by default. To Take full control over endpoints registration in the JMX domain, consider registering your own EndpointObjectNameFactory implementation.

### Customizing MBean Names

> The name of the MBean is usually generated from the id of the endpoint. For example, the health
>
> endpoint is exposed as org.springframework.boot:type=Endpoint,name=Health.
>
> If your application contains more than one Spring ApplicationContext, you may find that names clash. To solve this problem, you can set the spring.jmx.unique-names property to true so that MBean names are always unique.
>
> You can also customize the JMX domain under which endpoints are exposed. The following settings show an example of doing so in application.properties:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

### Disabling JMX Endpoints

> If you do not want to expose endpoints over JMX, you can set the
>
> management.endpoints.jmx.exposure.exclude property to \*, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

### Using Jolokia for JMX over HTTP

> Jolokia is a JMX-HTTP bridge that provides an alternative method of accessing JMX beans. To use Jolokia, include a dependency to org.jolokia:jolokia-core. For example, with Maven, you would
>
> add the following dependency:
>
> The Jolokia endpoint can then be exposed by adding jolokia or \* to the
>
> management.endpoints.web.exposure.include property. You can then access it by using
>
> /actuator/jolokia on your management HTTP server.

##### NOTE

> The Jolokia endpoint exposes Jolokia's servlet as an actuator endpoint. As a result, it is specific to servlet environments such as Spring MVC and Jersey. The endpoint will not be available in a WebFlux application.

##### Customizing Jolokia

> Jolokia has a number of settings that you would traditionally configure by setting servlet parameters. With Spring Boot, you can use your application.properties file. To do so, prefix the parameter with management.endpoint.jolokia.config., as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### Disabling Jolokia

> If you use Jolokia but do not want Spring Boot to configure it, set the
>
> management.endpoint.jolokia.enabled property to false, as follows:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

## Loggers

> Spring Boot Actuator includes the ability to view and configure the log levels of your application at runtime. You can view either the entire list or an individual logger's configuration, which is made up of both the explicitly configured logging level as well as the effective logging level given to it by the logging framework. These levels can be one of:

-   TRACE

-   DEBUG

-   INFO

-   WARN

-   ERROR

-   FATAL

-   OFF

-   null

> null indicates that there is no explicit configuration.

### Configure a Logger

> To configure a given logger, POST a partial entity to the resource's URI, as shown in the following example:

##### TIP

> To "reset" the specific level of the logger (and use the default configuration instead), you can pass a value of null as the configuredLevel.

## Metrics

> Spring Boot Actuator provides dependency management and auto-configuration for Micrometer, an application metrics facade that supports numerous monitoring systems, including:

-   [AppOptics](\l)

-   [Atlas](\l)

-   [Datadog](\l)

-   [Dynatrace](\l)

-   [Elastic](\l)

-   [Ganglia](\l)

-   [Graphite](\l)

-   [Humio](\l)

-   [Influx](\l)

-   [JMX](\l)

-   [KairosDB](\l)

-   [New Relic](\l)

-   [Prometheus](\l)

-   [SignalFx](\l)

-   [Simple (in-memory)](\l)

-   [Stackdriver](\l)

-   [StatsD](\l)

-   [Wavefront](\l)

> **TIP** To learn more about Micrometer's capabilities, please refer to its reference documentation, in particular the concepts section.

### Getting started

> Spring Boot auto-configures a composite MeterRegistry and adds a registry to the composite for each of the supported implementations that it finds on the classpath. Having a dependency on micrometer-registry-{system} in your runtime classpath is enough for Spring Boot to configure the registry.
>
> Most registries share common features. For instance, you can disable a particular registry even if the Micrometer registry implementation is on the classpath. For example, to disable Datadog:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> You can also disable all registries unless stated otherwise by the registry-specific property, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> Spring Boot will also add any auto-configured registries to the global static composite registry on the Metrics class unless you explicitly tell it not to:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> You can register any number of MeterRegistryCustomizer beans to further configure the registry, such as applying common tags, before any meters are registered with the registry:
>
> You can apply customizations to particular registry implementations by being more specific about the generic type:

#### import io.micrometer.core.instrument.Meter;

> import io.micrometer.core.instrument.config.NamingConvention; import io.micrometer.graphite.GraphiteMeterRegistry;
>
> import org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.metrics.MeterRegistryCustomizer; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
>
> import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
>
> \@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false) public class MyMeterRegistryConfiguration {
>
> \@Bean
>
> public MeterRegistryCustomizer\<GraphiteMeterRegistry> graphiteMetricsNamingConvention() {
>
> return (registry) -\> registry.config().namingConvention(this::name);
>
> }
>
> private String name(String name, Meter.Type type, String baseUnit) { return \...
>
> }
>
> }
>
> Spring Boot also [configures built-in instrumentation](\l) that you can control via configuration or dedicated annotation markers.

##### Prometheus

> Prometheus expects to scrape or poll individual app instances for metrics. Spring Boot provides an actuator endpoint available at /actuator/prometheus to present a Prometheus scrape with the appropriate format.
>
> **TIP** The endpoint is not available by default and must be exposed, see [exposing endpoints](\l) for more details.
>
> Here is an example scrape_config to add to prometheus.yml:
>
> For ephemeral or batch jobs which may not exist long enough to be scraped, Prometheus Pushgateway support can be used to expose their metrics to Prometheus. To enable Prometheus Pushgateway support, add the following dependency to your project:
>
> When the Prometheus Pushgateway dependency is present on the classpath and the management.metrics.export.prometheus.pushgateway.enabled property is set to true, a PrometheusPushGatewayManager bean is auto-configured. This manages the pushing of metrics to a Prometheus Pushgateway.

##### TIP

> If publishing metrics to a Wavefront proxy (as described in the documentation), the host must be in the proxy://HOST:PORT format.
>
> You can also change the interval at which metrics are sent to Wavefront:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

### Supported Metrics and Meters

> Spring Boot provides automatic meter registration for a wide variety of technologies. In most situations, the out-of-the-box defaults will provide sensible metrics that can be published to any of the supported monioring systems.

##### JVM Metrics

> Auto-configuration will enable JVM Metrics using core Micrometer classes. JVM metrics are published under the jvm. meter name.
>
> The following JVM metrics are provided:

-   Various memory and buffer pool details

-   Statistics related to garbage collection

-   Threads utilization

-   The Number of classes loaded/unloaded

##### System Metrics

> Auto-configuration will enable system metrics using core Micrometer classes. System metrics are published under the system. and process. meter names.
>
> The following system metrics are provided:

-   CPU metrics

-   File descriptor metrics

-   Uptime metrics (both the amount of time the application has been running as well as a fixed gauge of the absolute start time)

##### Logger Metrics

> Auto-configuration enables the event metrics for both Logback and Log4J2. Details are published under the log4j2.events. or logback.events. meter names.

##### Spring MVC Metrics

> Auto-configuration enables the instrumentation of all requests handled by Spring MVC controllers and functional handlers. By default, metrics are generated with the name, http.server.requests. The name can be customized by setting the management.metrics.web.server.request.metric-name property.
>
> \@Timed annotations are supported on \@Controller classes and \@RequestMapping methods (see [\@Timed](\l) [Annotation Support](\l) for details). If you don't want to record metrics for all Spring MVC requests, you can set management.metrics.web.server.request.autotime.enabled to false and exclusively use \@Timed annotations instead.
>
> By default, Spring MVC related metrics are tagged with the following information:

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Tag**                           | **Description**                                                                                                                         |

##### HTTP Client Metrics

> Spring Boot Actuator manages the instrumentation of both RestTemplate and WebClient. For that, you have to inject the auto-configured builder and use it to create instances:

-   RestTemplateBuilder for RestTemplate

-   WebClient.Builder for WebClient

> It is also possible to apply manually the customizers responsible for this instrumentation, namely
>
> MetricsRestTemplateCustomizer and MetricsWebClientCustomizer.
>
> By default, metrics are generated with the name, http.client.requests. The name can be customized by setting the management.metrics.web.client.request.metric-name property.

> To customize the tags, and depending on your choice of client, you can provide a \@Bean that implements RestTemplateExchangeTagsProvider or WebClientExchangeTagsProvider. There are convenience static functions in RestTemplateExchangeTags and WebClientExchangeTags.

##### Tomcat Metrics

> Auto-configuration will enable the instrumentation of Tomcat only when an MBeanRegistry is enabled. By default, the MBeanRegistry is disabled, but you can enable it by setting server.tomcat.mbeanregistry.enabled to true.
>
> Tomcat metrics are published under the tomcat. meter name.

##### Cache Metrics

> Auto-configuration enables the instrumentation of all available Caches on startup with metrics prefixed with cache. Cache instrumentation is standardized for a basic set of metrics. Additional, cache-specific metrics are also available.
>
> The following cache libraries are supported:

-   Caffeine

-   EhCache 2

-   Hazelcast

-   Any compliant JCache (JSR-107) implementation

-   Redis

> Metrics are tagged by the name of the cache and by the name of the CacheManager that is derived from the bean name.

##### NOTE

> Only caches that are configured on startup are bound to the registry. For caches not defined in the cache's configuration, e.g. caches created on-the-fly or programmatically after the startup phase, an explicit registration is required. A CacheMetricsRegistrar bean is made available to make that process easier.

##### DataSource Metrics

> Auto-configuration enables the instrumentation of all available DataSource objects with metrics prefixed with jdbc.connections. Data source instrumentation results in gauges representing the currently active, idle, maximum allowed, and minimum allowed connections in the pool.
>
> Metrics are also tagged by the name of the DataSource computed based on the bean name.

##### TIP

> By default, Spring Boot provides metadata for all supported data sources; you can add additional DataSourcePoolMetadataProvider beans if your favorite data source isn't supported out of the box. See DataSourcePoolMetadataProvidersConfiguration for examples.
>
> Also, Hikari-specific metrics are exposed with a hikaricp prefix. Each metric is tagged by the name of the Pool (can be controlled with spring.datasource.name).

##### Hibernate Metrics

> If org.hibernate:hibernate-micrometer is on the classpath, all available Hibernate EntityManagerFactory instances that have statistics enabled are instrumented with a metric named hibernate.
>
> Metrics are also tagged by the name of the EntityManagerFactory that is derived from the bean name.
>
> To enable statistics, the standard JPA property hibernate.generate_statistics must be set to true. You can enable that on the auto-configured EntityManagerFactory as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### Spring Data Repository Metrics

> Auto-configuration enables the instrumentation of all Spring Data Repository method invocations.
>
> By default, metrics are generated with the name, spring.data.repository.invocations. The name can be customized by setting the management.metrics.data.repository.metric-name property.
>
> \@Timed annotations are supported on Repository classes and methods (see [\@Timed Annotation](\l) [Support](\l) for details). If you don't want to record metrics for all Repository invocations, you can set management.metrics.data.repository.autotime.enabled to false and exclusively use \@Timed annotations instead.
>
> By default, repository invocation related metrics are tagged with the following information:

##### Jetty Metrics

> Auto-configuration will bind metrics for Jetty's ThreadPool using Micrometer's
>
> JettyServerThreadPoolMetrics.

##### \@Timed Annotation Support

> The \@Timed annotation from the io.micrometer.core.annotation package can be used with several of the supported technologies listed above. If supported, the annotation can be used either at the class- level or the method-level.
>
> For example, the following code shows how the annotation can be used to instrument all request mappings in a \@RestController:
>
> If you only want to instrument a single mapping, you can use the annotation on the method instead of the class:
>
> You can also combine class-level and method-level annotations if you want to change timing details for a specific method:

##### NOTE

> A \@Timed annotation with longTask = true will enable a long task timer for the method. Long task timers require a separate metric name, and can be stacked with a short task timer.

### Registering Custom Metrics

> To register custom metrics, inject MeterRegistry into your component, as shown in the following example:
>
> If your metrics depend on other beans, it is recommended that you use a MeterBinder to register them, as shown in the following example:
>
> Using a MeterBinder ensures that the correct dependency relationships are set up and that the bean is available when the metric's value is retrieved. A MeterBinder implementation can also be useful if you find that you repeatedly instrument a suite of metrics across components or applications.
>
> **NOTE** By default, metrics from all MeterBinder beans will be automatically bound to the Spring-managed MeterRegistry.

### Customizing Individual Metrics

> If you need to apply customizations to specific Meter instances you can use the
>
> io.micrometer.core.instrument.config.MeterFilter interface.
>
> For example, if you want to rename the mytag.region tag to mytag.area for all meter IDs beginning with com.example, you can do the following:

##### NOTE

> By default, all MeterFilter beans will be automatically bound to the Spring-managed MeterRegistry. Make sure to register your metrics using the Spring-managed MeterRegistry and not any of the static methods on Metrics. These use the global registry that is not Spring-managed.

##### Common Tags

> Common tags are generally used for dimensional drill-down on the operating environment like host, instance, region, stack, etc. Commons tags are applied to all meters and can be configured as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> The example above adds region and stack tags to all meters with a value of us-east-1 and prod
>
> respectively.

##### NOTE

> The order of common tags is important if you are using Graphite. As the order of common tags cannot be guaranteed using this approach, Graphite users are advised to define a custom MeterFilter instead.

##### Per-meter Properties

> In addition to MeterFilter beans, it's also possible to apply a limited set of customization on a per- meter basis using properties. Per-meter customizations apply to any all meter IDs that start with the given name. For example, the following will disable any meters that have an ID starting with
>
> example.remote
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> The following properties allow per-meter customization:
>
> *Table 9. Per-meter customizations*

### Metrics Endpoint

> Spring Boot provides a metrics endpoint that can be used diagnostically to examine the metrics collected by an application. The endpoint is not available by default and must be exposed, see [exposing endpoints](\l) for more details.
>
> Navigating to /actuator/metrics displays a list of available meter names. You can drill down to view information about a particular meter by providing its name as a selector, e.g.
>
> /actuator/metrics/jvm.memory.max.

##### TIP

> The name you use here should match the name used in the code, not the name after it has been naming-convention normalized for a monitoring system it is shipped to. In other words, if jvm.memory.max appears as jvm_memory_max in Prometheus because of its snake case naming convention, you should still use jvm.memory.max as the selector when inspecting the meter in the metrics endpoint.
>
> You can also add any number of tag=KEY:VALUE query parameters to the end of the URL to dimensionally drill down on a meter, e.g. /actuator/metrics/jvm.memory.max?tag=area:nonheap.

##### TIP

> The reported measurements are the *sum* of the statistics of all meters matching the meter name and any tags that have been applied. So in the example above, the returned \"Value\" statistic is the sum of the maximum memory footprints of \"Code Cache\", \"Compressed Class Space\", and \"Metaspace\" areas of the heap. If you only wanted to see the maximum size for the \"Metaspace\", you could add an additional tag=id:Metaspace, i.e.
>
> /actuator/metrics/jvm.memory.max?tag=area:nonheap&tag=id:Metaspace.

## Auditing

> Once Spring Security is in play, Spring Boot Actuator has a flexible audit framework that publishes events (by default, "authentication success", "failure" and "access denied" exceptions). This feature can be very useful for reporting and for implementing a lock-out policy based on authentication failures.
>
> Auditing can be enabled by providing a bean of type AuditEventRepository in your application's configuration. For convenience, Spring Boot offers an InMemoryAuditEventRepository. InMemoryAuditEventRepository has limited capabilities and we recommend using it only for development environments. For production environments, consider creating your own alternative AuditEventRepository implementation.

### Custom Auditing

> To customize published security events, you can provide your own implementations of
>
> AbstractAuthenticationAuditListener and AbstractAuthorizationAuditListener.
>
> You can also use the audit services for your own business events. To do so, either inject the AuditEventRepository bean into your own components and use that directly or publish an AuditApplicationEvent with the Spring ApplicationEventPublisher (by implementing
>
> ApplicationEventPublisherAware).

## HTTP Tracing

> HTTP Tracing can be enabled by providing a bean of type HttpTraceRepository in your application's configuration. For convenience, Spring Boot offers an InMemoryHttpTraceRepository that stores traces for the last 100 request-response exchanges, by default. InMemoryHttpTraceRepository is limited compared to other tracing solutions and we recommend using it only for development environments. For production environments, use of a production-ready tracing or observability solution, such as Zipkin or Spring Cloud Sleuth, is recommended. Alternatively, create your own HttpTraceRepository that meets your needs.
>
> The httptrace endpoint can be used to obtain information about the request-response exchanges that are stored in the HttpTraceRepository.

### Custom HTTP tracing

> To customize the items that are included in each trace, use the management.trace.http.include configuration property. For advanced customization, consider registering your own HttpExchangeTracer implementation.

## Process Monitoring

> In the spring-boot module, you can find two classes to create files that are often useful for process monitoring:

-   ApplicationPidFileWriter creates a file containing the application PID (by default, in the application directory with a file name of application.pid).

-   WebServerPortFileWriter creates a file (or files) containing the ports of the running web server (by default, in the application directory with a file name of application.port).

> By default, these writers are not activated, but you can enable:

-   [By Extending Configuration](\l)

-   [Programmatically](\l)

    1.  ### Extending Configuration

> In the META-INF/spring.factories file, you can activate the listener(s) that writes a PID file, as shown in the following example:

### Programmatically

> You can also activate a listener by invoking the SpringApplication.addListeners(...) method and passing the appropriate Writer object. This method also lets you customize the file name and path in the Writer constructor.

## Cloud Foundry Support

> Spring Boot's actuator module includes additional support that is activated when you deploy to a compatible Cloud Foundry instance. The /cloudfoundryapplication path provides an alternative secured route to all \@Endpoint beans.
>
> The extended support lets Cloud Foundry management UIs (such as the web application that you can use to view deployed applications) be augmented with Spring Boot actuator information. For example, an application status page may include full health information instead of the typical "running" or "stopped" status.
>
> **NOTE** The /cloudfoundryapplication path is not directly accessible to regular users. In order to use the endpoint, a valid UAA token must be passed with the request.

### Disabling Extended Cloud Foundry Actuator Support

> If you want to fully disable the /cloudfoundryapplication endpoints, you can add the following setting to your application.properties file:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

### Cloud Foundry Self-signed Certificates

> By default, the security verification for /cloudfoundryapplication endpoints makes SSL calls to various Cloud Foundry services. If your Cloud Foundry UAA or Cloud Controller services use self- signed certificates, you need to set the following property:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

### Custom Context Path

> If the server's context-path has been configured to anything other than /, the Cloud Foundry endpoints will not be available at the root of the application. For example, if server.servlet.context-path=/app, Cloud Foundry endpoints will be available at
>
> /app/cloudfoundryapplication/\*.
>
> If you expect the Cloud Foundry endpoints to always be available at /cloudfoundryapplication/\*, regardless of the server's context-path, you will need to explicitly configure that in your application. The configuration will differ depending on the web server in use. For Tomcat, the following configuration can be added:

#### import java.io.IOException; import java.util.Collections;

> import javax.servlet.GenericServlet; import javax.servlet.Servlet;
>
> import javax.servlet.ServletContainerInitializer; import javax.servlet.ServletContext;
>
> import javax.servlet.ServletException; import javax.servlet.ServletRequest; import javax.servlet.ServletResponse;
>
> import org.apache.catalina.Host;
>
> import org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContext; import org.apache.catalina.startup.Tomcat;
>
> import org.springframework.boot.web.embedded.tomcat.TomcatServletWebServerFactory; import org.springframework.boot.web.servlet.ServletContextInitializer;
>
> import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
>
> import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
>
> \@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false) public class MyCloudFoundryConfiguration {
>
> \@Bean
>
> public TomcatServletWebServerFactory servletWebServerFactory() { return new TomcatServletWebServerFactory() {
>
> \@Override
>
> protected void prepareContext(Host host, ServletContextInitializer\[\] initializers) {
>
> super.prepareContext(host, initializers);

## What to Read Next

> Otherwise, you can continue on, to read about ['deployment options'](\l) or jump ahead for some in- depth information about Spring Boot's [*build tool plugins*](\l).

# Chapter 9. Deploying Spring Boot Applications

> Spring Boot's flexible packaging options provide a great deal of choice when it comes to deploying your application. You can deploy Spring Boot applications to a variety of cloud platforms, to container images (such as Docker), or to virtual/real machines.
>
> This section covers some of the more common deployment scenarios.

## Deploying to Containers

> If you are running your application from a container, you can use an executable jar, but it is also often an advantage to explode it and run it in a different way. Certain PaaS implementations may also choose to unpack archives before they run. For example, Cloud Foundry operates this way. One way to run an unpacked archive is by starting the appropriate launcher, as follows:
>
> This is actually slightly faster on startup (depending on the size of the jar) than running from an unexploded archive. At runtime you shouldn't expect any differences.
>
> Once you have unpacked the jar file, you can also get an extra boost to startup time by running the app with its \"natural\" main method instead of the JarLauncher. For example:

##### NOTE

> Using the JarLauncher over the application's main method has the added benefit of a predictable classpath order. The jar contains a classpath.idx file which is used by the JarLauncher when constructing the classpath.
>
> More efficient container images can also be created by [creating separate layers](\l) for your dependencies and application classes and resources (which normally change more frequently).

## Deploying to the Cloud

> Spring Boot's executable jars are ready-made for most popular cloud PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) providers. These providers tend to require that you "bring your own container". They manage application processes (not Java applications specifically), so they need an intermediary layer that adapts *your* application to the *cloud's* notion of a running process.
>
> Two popular cloud providers, Heroku and Cloud Foundry, employ a "buildpack" approach. The buildpack wraps your deployed code in whatever is needed to *start* your application. It might be a
>
> JDK and a call to java, an embedded web server, or a full-fledged application server. A buildpack is pluggable, but ideally you should be able to get by with as few customizations to it as possible. This reduces the footprint of functionality that is not under your control. It minimizes divergence between development and production environments.
>
> Ideally, your application, like a Spring Boot executable jar, has everything that it needs to run packaged within it.
>
> In this section, we look at what it takes to get the [application that we developed](\l) in the "Getting Started" section up and running in the Cloud.

### Cloud Foundry

> Cloud Foundry provides default buildpacks that come into play if no other buildpack is specified. The Cloud Foundry Java buildpack has excellent support for Spring applications, including Spring Boot. You can deploy stand-alone executable jar applications as well as traditional .war packaged applications.
>
> Once you have built your application (by using, for example, mvn clean package) and have installed the cf command line tool, deploy your application by using the cf push command, substituting the path to your compiled .jar. Be sure to have logged in with your cf command line client before pushing an application. The following line shows using the cf push command to deploy an application:

##### NOTE

> In the preceding example, we substitute acloudyspringtime for whatever value you give cf as the name of your application.
>
> See the cf push documentation for more options. If there is a Cloud Foundry manifest.yml file present in the same directory, it is considered.
>
> At this point, cf starts uploading your application, producing output similar to the following example:
>
> Uploading acloudyspringtime\... OK
>
> Preparing to start acloudyspringtime\... OK

> Once Cloud Foundry acknowledges that your application has been deployed, you should be able to find the application at the URI given. In the preceding example, you could find it at https://acloudyspringtime.cfapps.io/.

##### Binding to Services

> By default, metadata about the running application as well as service connection information is exposed to the application as environment variables (for example: \$VCAP_SERVICES). This architecture decision is due to Cloud Foundry's polyglot (any language and platform can be supported as a buildpack) nature. Process-scoped environment variables are language agnostic.
>
> Environment variables do not always make for the easiest API, so Spring Boot automatically extracts them and flattens the data into properties that can be accessed through Spring's Environment abstraction, as shown in the following example:
>
> All Cloud Foundry properties are prefixed with vcap. You can use vcap properties to access application information (such as the public URL of the application) and service information (such as database credentials). See the 'CloudFoundryVcapEnvironmentPostProcessor' Javadoc for complete details.
>
> **TIP** The Java CFEnv project is a better fit for tasks such as configuring a DataSource.

### Kubernetes

> Spring Boot auto-detects Kubernetes deployment environments by checking the environment for \"\*\_SERVICE_HOST\" and \"\*\_SERVICE_PORT\" variables. You can override this detection with the spring.main.cloud-platform configuration property.
>
> Spring Boot helps you to [manage the state of your application](\l) and export it with [HTTP Kubernetes](\l) [Probes using Actuator](\l).

##### Kubernetes Container Lifecycle

> When Kubernetes deletes an application instance, the shutdown process involves several subsystems concurrently: shutdown hooks, unregistering the service, removing the instance from the load-balancer... Because this shutdown processing happens in parallel (and due to the nature of distributed systems), there is a window during which traffic can be routed to a pod that has also begun its shutdown processing.
>
> You can configure a sleep execution in a preStop handler to avoid requests being routed to a pod that has already begun shutting down. This sleep should be long enough for new requests to stop being routed to the pod and its duration will vary from deployment to deployment. The preStop handler can be configured via the PodSpec in the pod's configuration file as follows:
>
> Once the pre-stop hook has completed, SIGTERM will be sent to the container and [graceful](\l) [shutdown](\l) will begin, allowing any remaining in-flight requests to complete.

##### NOTE

> When Kubernetes sends a SIGTERM signal to the pod, it waits for a specified time called the termination grace period (the default for which is 30 seconds). If the containers are still running after the grace period, they are sent the SIGKILL signal and forcibly removed. If the pod takes longer than 30 seconds to shut down, which could be because you've increased spring.lifecycle.timeout-per-shutdown-phase, make sure to increase the termination grace period by setting the terminationGracePeriodSeconds option in the Pod YAML.

### Heroku

> Heroku is another popular PaaS platform. To customize Heroku builds, you provide a Procfile, which provides the incantation required to deploy an application. Heroku assigns a port for the Java application to use and then ensures that routing to the external URI works.
>
> You must configure your application to listen on the correct port. The following example shows the
>
> Procfile for our starter REST application:
>
> Spring Boot makes -D arguments available as properties accessible from a Spring Environment instance. The server.port configuration property is fed to the embedded Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow instance, which then uses the port when it starts up. The \$PORT environment variable is assigned to
>
> us by the Heroku PaaS.
>
> This should be everything you need. The most common deployment workflow for Heroku deployments is to git push the code to production, as shown in the following example:
>
> Which will result in the following:

### OpenShift

> OpenShift has many resources describing how to deploy Spring Boot applications, including:

-   Using the S2I builder

-   Architecture guide

-   Running as a traditional web application on Wildfly

-   OpenShift Commons Briefing

### Amazon Web Services (AWS)

> Amazon Web Services offers multiple ways to install Spring Boot-based applications, either as traditional web applications (war) or as executable jar files with an embedded web server. The options include:

-   AWS Elastic Beanstalk

-   AWS Code Deploy

-   AWS OPS Works

-   AWS Cloud Formation

-   AWS Container Registry

> Each has different features and pricing models. In this document, we describe to approach using AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

##### AWS Elastic Beanstalk

> As described in the official Elastic Beanstalk Java guide, there are two main options to deploy a Java application. You can either use the "Tomcat Platform" or the "Java SE platform".
>
> **Using the Tomcat Platform**
>
> This option applies to Spring Boot projects that produce a war file. No special configuration is required. You need only follow the official guide.
>
> **Using the Java SE Platform**
>
> This option applies to Spring Boot projects that produce a jar file and run an embedded web container. Elastic Beanstalk environments run an nginx instance on port 80 to proxy the actual application, running on port 5000. To configure it, add the following line to your application.properties file:

##### TIP

> *Upload binaries instead of sources*
>
> By default, Elastic Beanstalk uploads sources and compiles them in AWS. However, it is best to upload the binaries instead. To do so, add lines similar to the following to your .elasticbeanstalk/config.yml file:

##### TIP

> *Reduce costs by setting the environment type*
>
> By default an Elastic Beanstalk environment is load balanced. The load balancer has a significant cost. To avoid that cost, set the environment type to "Single instance", as described in the Amazon documentation. You can also create single instance environments by using the CLI and the following command:

##### Summary

> This is one of the easiest ways to get to AWS, but there are more things to cover, such as how to integrate Elastic Beanstalk into any CI / CD tool, use the Elastic Beanstalk Maven plugin instead of the CLI, and others. There is a blog post covering these topics more in detail.

### Boxfuse and Amazon Web Services

> Boxfuse works by turning your Spring Boot executable jar or war into a minimal VM image that can be deployed unchanged either on VirtualBox or on AWS. Boxfuse comes with deep integration for Spring Boot and uses the information from your Spring Boot configuration file to automatically configure ports and health check URLs. Boxfuse leverages this information both for the images it produces as well as for all the resources it provisions (instances, security groups, elastic load balancers, and so on).
>
> Once you have created a Boxfuse account, connected it to your AWS account, installed the latest version of the Boxfuse Client, and ensured that the application has been built by Maven or Gradle (by using, for example, mvn clean package), you can deploy your Spring Boot application to AWS with a command similar to the following:
>
> See the boxfuse run documentation for more options. If there is a boxfuse.conf file present in the current directory, it is considered.

##### TIP

> By default, Boxfuse activates a Spring profile named boxfuse on startup. If your executable jar or war contains an application-boxfuse.properties file, Boxfuse bases its configuration on the properties it contains.
>
> At this point, boxfuse creates an image for your application, uploads it, and configures and starts the necessary resources on AWS, resulting in output similar to the following example:
>
> Fusing Image for myapp-1.0.jar \...

>
> See the blog post on deploying Spring Boot apps on EC2 as well as the documentation for the Boxfuse Spring Boot integration to get started with a Maven build to run the app.

### Azure

> This Getting Started guide walks you through deploying your Spring Boot application to either Azure Spring Cloud or Azure App Service.

### Google Cloud

> Google Cloud has several options that can be used to launch Spring Boot applications. The easiest to get started with is probably App Engine, but you could also find ways to run Spring Boot in a container with Container Engine or on a virtual machine with Compute Engine.
>
> To run in App Engine, you can create a project in the UI first, which sets up a unique identifier for you and also sets up HTTP routes. Add a Java app to the project and leave it empty and then use the Google Cloud SDK to push your Spring Boot app into that slot from the command line or CI build.
>
> App Engine Standard requires you to use WAR packaging. Follow these steps to deploy App Engine Standard application to Google Cloud.
>
> Alternatively, App Engine Flex requires you to create an app.yaml file to describe the resources your
>
> app requires. Normally, you put this file in src/main/appengine, and it should resemble the following file:
>
> You can deploy the app (for example, with a Maven plugin) by adding the project ID to the build configuration, as shown in the following example:
>
> Then deploy with mvn appengine:deploy (if you need to authenticate first, the build fails).

## Installing Spring Boot Applications

> In addition to running Spring Boot applications by using java -jar, it is also possible to make fully executable applications for Unix systems. A fully executable jar can be executed like any other executable binary or it can be [registered with](\l) [init.d](\l) [or](\l) [systemd](\l). This helps when installing and managing Spring Boot applications in common production environments.

##### CAUTION

> Fully executable jars work by embedding an extra script at the front of the file. Currently, some tools do not accept this format, so you may not always be able to use this technique. For example, jar -xf may silently fail to extract a jar or war that has been made fully executable. It is recommended that you make your jar or war fully executable only if you intend to execute it directly, rather than running it with java -jar or deploying it to a servlet container.

##### CAUTION

> A zip64-format jar file cannot be made fully executable. Attempting to do so will result in a jar file that is reported as corrupt when executed directly or with java -jar. A standard-format jar file that contains one or more zip64-format nested jars can be fully executable.
>
> To create a 'fully executable' jar with Maven, use the following plugin configuration:
>
> The following example shows the equivalent Gradle configuration:
>
> You can then run your application by typing ./my-application.jar (where my-application is the name of your artifact). The directory containing the jar is used as your application's working directory.

1.  **Supported Operating Systems**

> The default script supports most Linux distributions and is tested on CentOS and Ubuntu. Other platforms, such as OS X and FreeBSD, require the use of a custom embeddedLaunchScript.

### Unix/Linux Services

> Spring Boot application can be easily started as Unix/Linux services by using either init.d or
>
> systemd.

##### Installation as an init.d Service (System V)

> If you configured Spring Boot's Maven or Gradle plugin to generate a [fully executable jar](\l), and you do not use a custom embeddedLaunchScript, your application can be used as an init.d service. To do
>
> so, symlink the jar to init.d to support the standard start, stop, restart, and status commands. The script supports the following features:

-   Starts the services as the user that owns the jar file

-   Tracks the application's PID by using /var/run/\<appname>/\<appname>.pid

-   Writes console logs to /var/log/\<appname>.log

> Assuming that you have a Spring Boot application installed in /var/myapp, to install a Spring Boot application as an init.d service, create a symlink, as follows:
>
> Once installed, you can start and stop the service in the usual way. For example, on a Debian-based system, you could start it with the following command:

##### TIP

> If your application fails to start, check the log file written to /var/log/\<appname>.log for errors.
>
> You can also flag the application to start automatically by using your standard operating system tools. For example, on Debian, you could use the following command:
>
> **Securing an init.d Service**

##### NOTE

> The following is a set of guidelines on how to secure a Spring Boot application that runs as an init.d service. It is not intended to be an exhaustive list of everything that should be done to harden an application and the environment in which it runs.
>
> When executed as root, as is the case when root is being used to start an init.d service, the default executable script runs the application as the user specified in the RUN_AS_USER environment variable. When the environment variable is not set, the user who owns the jar file is used instead. You should never run a Spring Boot application as root, so RUN_AS_USER should never be root and your application's jar file should never be owned by root. Instead, create a specific user to run your application and set the RUN_AS_USER environment variable or use chown to make it the owner of the jar file, as shown in the following example:
>
> In this case, the default executable script runs the application as the bootapp user.

##### TIP

> To reduce the chances of the application's user account being compromised, you should consider preventing it from using a login shell. For example, you can set the account's shell to /usr/sbin/nologin.
>
> You should also take steps to prevent the modification of your application's jar file. Firstly, configure its permissions so that it cannot be written and can only be read or executed by its owner, as shown in the following example:
>
> Second, you should also take steps to limit the damage if your application or the account that's running it is compromised. If an attacker does gain access, they could make the jar file writable and change its contents. One way to protect against this is to make it immutable by using chattr, as shown in the following example:
>
> This will prevent any user, including root, from modifying the jar.
>
> If root is used to control the application's service and you [use a](\l) [.conf](\l) [file](\l) to customize its startup, the .conf file is read and evaluated by the root user. It should be secured accordingly. Use chmod so that the file can only be read by the owner and use chown to make root the owner, as shown in the following example:

##### Installation as a systemd Service

> systemd is the successor of the System V init system and is now being used by many modern Linux distributions. Although you can continue to use init.d scripts with systemd, it is also possible to launch Spring Boot applications by using systemd 'service' scripts.
>
> Assuming that you have a Spring Boot application installed in /var/myapp, to install a Spring Boot application as a systemd service, create a script named myapp.service and place it in
>
> /etc/systemd/system directory. The following script offers an example:

##### IMPORTANT

> Remember to change the Description, User, and ExecStart fields for your application.

##### NOTE

> The ExecStart field does not declare the script action command, which means that the run command is used by default.
>
> Note that, unlike when running as an init.d service, the user that runs the application, the PID file, and the console log file are managed by systemd itself and therefore must be configured by using appropriate fields in the 'service' script. Consult the service unit configuration man page for more details.
>
> To flag the application to start automatically on system boot, use the following command:
>
> Refer to man systemctl for more details.

##### Customizing the Startup Script

> The default embedded startup script written by the Maven or Gradle plugin can be customized in a number of ways. For most people, using the default script along with a few customizations is usually enough. If you find you cannot customize something that you need to, use the embeddedLaunchScript option to write your own file entirely.
>
> **Customizing the Start Script When It Is Written**
>
> It often makes sense to customize elements of the start script as it is written into the jar file. For example, init.d scripts can provide a "description". Since you know the description up front (and it need not change), you may as well provide it when the jar is generated.
>
> To customize written elements, use the embeddedLaunchScriptProperties option of the Spring Boot Maven plugin or the properties property of the Spring Boot Gradle plugin's launchScript.
>
> The following property substitutions are supported with the default script:

> **Customizing a Script When It Runs**
>
> For items of the script that need to be customized *after* the jar has been written, you can use environment variables or a [config file](\l).
>
> The following environment properties are supported with the default script:

------------------------ -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Variable**             **Description**

  MODE                     The "mode" of operation. The default depends on the way the jar was built but is usually auto (meaning it tries to guess if it is an init script by checking if it is a symlink in a directory called init.d). You can explicitly set it to service so that the stop\|start\|status\|restart commands work or to run if you want to run the script in the foreground.

  RUN_AS_USER              The user that will be used to run the application. When not set, the user that owns the jar file will be used.

  USE_START_ST OP_DAEMON   Whether the start-stop-daemon command, when it's available, should be used to control the process. Defaults to true.

  PID_FOLDER               The root name of the pid folder (/var/run by default).

  LOG_FOLDER               The name of the folder in which to put log files (/var/log by default).

  CONF_FOLDER              The name of the folder from which to read .conf files (same folder as jar-file by default).

  LOG_FILENAME             The name of the log file in the LOG_FOLDER (\<appname>.log by default).

  APP_NAME                 The name of the app. If the jar is run from a symlink, the script guesses the app name. If it is not a symlink or you want to explicitly set the app name, this can be useful.

  RUN_ARGS                 The arguments to pass to the program (the Spring Boot app).

  JAVA_HOME                The location of the java executable is discovered by using the PATH by default, but you can set it explicitly if there is an executable file at \$JAVA_HOME/bin/java.
------------------------ -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Variable**      **Description**

  JAVA_OPTS         Options that are passed to the JVM when it is launched.

  JARFILE           The explicit location of the jar file, in case the script is being used to launch a jar that it is not actually embedded.

  DEBUG             If not empty, sets the -x flag on the shell process, allowing you to see the logic in the script.

  STOP_WAIT_TI ME   The time in seconds to wait when stopping the application before forcing a shutdown (60 by default).
----------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### NOTE

> The PID_FOLDER, LOG_FOLDER, and LOG_FILENAME variables are only valid for an init.d service. For systemd, the equivalent customizations are made by using the 'service' script. See the service unit configuration man page for more details.
>
> With the exception of JARFILE and APP_NAME, the settings listed in the preceding section can be configured by using a .conf file. The file is expected to be next to the jar file and have the same name but suffixed with .conf rather than .jar. For example, a jar named /var/myapp/myapp.jar uses the configuration file named /var/myapp/myapp.conf, as shown in the following example:
>
> *myapp.conf*

##### TIP

> If you do not like having the config file next to the jar file, you can set a CONF_FOLDER
>
> environment variable to customize the location of the config file.
>
> To learn about securing this file appropriately, see [the guidelines for securing an init.d service](\l).

### Microsoft Windows Services

> A Spring Boot application can be started as a Windows service by using winsw.
>
> A (separately maintained sample) describes step-by-step how you can create a Windows service for your Spring Boot application.

## What to Read Next

> Check out the Cloud Foundry, Heroku, OpenShift, and Boxfuse web sites for more information about the kinds of features that a PaaS can offer. These are just four of the most popular Java PaaS providers. Since Spring Boot is so amenable to cloud-based deployment, you can freely consider other providers as well.
>
> The next section goes on to cover the [*Spring Boot CLI*](\l), or you can jump ahead to read about *[build](\l)* [*tool plugins*](\l).

# Chapter 10. Spring Boot CLI

> The Spring Boot CLI is a command line tool that you can use if you want to quickly develop a Spring application. It lets you run Groovy scripts, which means that you have a familiar Java-like syntax without so much boilerplate code. You can also bootstrap a new project or write your own command for it.

## Installing the CLI

> The Spring Boot CLI (Command-Line Interface) can be installed manually by using SDKMAN! (the SDK Manager) or by using Homebrew or MacPorts if you are an OSX user. See *[Installing the Spring](\l)* [*Boot CLI*](\l) in the "Getting started" section for comprehensive installation instructions.

## Using the CLI

> Once you have installed the CLI, you can run it by typing spring and pressing Enter at the command line. If you run spring without any arguments, a help screen is displayed, as follows:
>
> You can type spring help to get more details about any of the supported commands, as shown in the following example:
>
> The version command provides a quick way to check which version of Spring Boot you are using, as follows:

### Running Applications with the CLI

> You can compile and run Groovy source code by using the run command. The Spring Boot CLI is completely self-contained, so you do not need any external Groovy installation.
>
> The following example shows a "hello world" web application written in Groovy:
>
> *hello.groovy*
>
> To compile and run the application, type the following command:
>
> To pass command-line arguments to the application, use \-- to separate the commands from the "spring" command arguments, as shown in the following example:
>
> To set JVM command line arguments, you can use the JAVA_OPTS environment variable, as shown in the following example:

##### NOTE

> When setting JAVA_OPTS on Microsoft Windows, make sure to quote the entire instruction, such as set \"JAVA_OPTS=-Xms256m -Xmx2048m\". Doing so ensures the values are properly passed to the process.

##### Deduced "grab" Dependencies

> Standard Groovy includes a \@Grab annotation, which lets you declare dependencies on third-party libraries. This useful technique lets Groovy download jars in the same way as Maven or Gradle would but without requiring you to use a build tool.
>
> Spring Boot extends this technique further and tries to deduce which libraries to "grab" based on your code. For example, since the WebApplication code shown previously uses \@RestController annotations, Spring Boot grabs \"Tomcat\" and \"Spring MVC\".
>
> The following items are used as "grab hints":

------------------------------------------------------ -----------------------------------
  **Items**                                              **Grabs**

  JdbcTemplate, NamedParameterJdbcTemplate, DataSource   JDBC Application.

  \@EnableJms                                            JMS Application.

  \@EnableCaching                                        Caching abstraction.

  \@Test                                                 JUnit.

  \@EnableRabbit                                         RabbitMQ.

  extends Specification                                  Spock test.

  \@EnableBatchProcessing                                Spring Batch.

  \@MessageEndpoint \@EnableIntegration                  Spring Integration.

  \@Controller \@RestController \@EnableWebMvc           Spring MVC + Embedded Tomcat.

  \@EnableWebSecurity                                    Spring Security.

  \@EnableTransactionManagement                          Spring Transaction Management.
------------------------------------------------------ -----------------------------------

##### TIP

> See subclasses of CompilerAutoConfiguration in the Spring Boot CLI source code to understand exactly how customizations are applied.

##### Deduced "grab" Coordinates

> Spring Boot extends Groovy's standard \@Grab support by letting you specify a dependency without a group or version (for example, \@Grab(\'freemarker\')). Doing so consults Spring Boot's default dependency metadata to deduce the artifact's group and version.

##### NOTE

> The default metadata is tied to the version of the CLI that you use. It changes only when you move to a new version of the CLI, putting you in control of when the versions of your dependencies may change. A table showing the dependencies and their versions that are included in the default metadata can be found in the [appendix](\l).

##### Default Import Statements

> To help reduce the size of your Groovy code, several import statements are automatically included. Notice how the preceding example refers to \@Component, \@RestController, and \@RequestMapping without needing to use fully-qualified names or import statements.
>
> **TIP** Many Spring annotations work without using import statements. Try running your application to see what fails before adding imports.

##### Automatic Main Method

> Unlike the equivalent Java application, you do not need to include a public static void main(String\[\] args) method with your Groovy scripts. A SpringApplication is automatically created, with your compiled code acting as the source.

##### Custom Dependency Management

> By default, the CLI uses the dependency management declared in spring-boot-dependencies when resolving \@Grab dependencies. Additional dependency management, which overrides the default dependency management, can be configured by using the \@DependencyManagementBom annotation. The annotation's value should specify the coordinates (groupId:artifactId:version) of one or more Maven BOMs.
>
> For example, consider the following declaration:
>
> The preceding declaration picks up custom-bom-1.0.0.pom in a Maven repository under
>
> com/example/custom-versions/1.0.0/.
>
> When you specify multiple BOMs, they are applied in the order in which you declare them, as shown in the following example:
>
> The preceding example indicates that the dependency management in another-bom overrides the dependency management in custom-bom.
>
> You can use \@DependencyManagementBom anywhere that you can use \@Grab. However, to ensure consistent ordering of the dependency management, you can use \@DependencyManagementBom at most once in your application.

### Applications with Multiple Source Files

> You can use "shell globbing" with all commands that accept file input. Doing so lets you use multiple files from a single directory, as shown in the following example:

### Packaging Your Application

> You can use the jar command to package your application into a self-contained executable jar file, as shown in the following example:
>
> The resulting jar contains the classes produced by compiling the application and all of the application's dependencies so that it can then be run by using java -jar. The jar file also contains entries from the application's classpath. You can add and remove explicit paths to the jar by using
>
> \--include and \--exclude. Both are comma-separated, and both accept prefixes, in the form of "+" and "-", to signify that they should be removed from the defaults. The default includes are as follows:
>
> The default excludes are as follows:
>
> Type spring help jar on the command line for more information.

### Initialize a New Project

> The init command lets you create a new project by using start.spring.io without leaving the shell, as shown in the following example:
>
> The preceding example creates a my-project directory with a Maven-based project that uses spring- boot-starter-web and spring-boot-starter-data-jpa. You can list the capabilities of the service by using the \--list flag, as shown in the following example:

#### \$ spring init \--list

> =======================================
>
> Capabilities of https://start.spring.io
>
> =======================================
>
> Available dependencies:
>
> \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--
>
> actuator - Actuator: Production ready features to help you monitor and manage your application
>
> \...
>
> web - Web: Support for full-stack web development, including Tomcat and spring-webmvc websocket - Websocket: Support for WebSocket development
>
> ws - WS: Support for Spring Web Services
>
> Available project types:
>
> \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--
>
> gradle-build - Gradle Config \[format:build, build:gradle\] gradle-project - Gradle Project \[format:project, build:gradle\] maven-build - Maven POM \[format:build, build:maven\]
>
> maven-project - Maven Project \[format:project, build:maven\] (default)
>
> \...
>
> The init command supports many options. See the help output for more details. For instance, the following command creates a Gradle project that uses Java 8 and war packaging:

### Using the Embedded Shell

> Spring Boot includes command-line completion scripts for the BASH and zsh shells. If you do not use either of these shells (perhaps you are a Windows user), you can use the shell command to launch an integrated shell, as shown in the following example:
>
> From inside the embedded shell, you can run other commands directly:
>
> The embedded shell supports ANSI color output as well as tab completion. If you need to run a native command, you can use the ! prefix. To exit the embedded shell, press ctrl-c.

### Adding Extensions to the CLI

> You can add extensions to the CLI by using the install command. The command takes one or more sets of artifact coordinates in the format group:artifact:version, as shown in the following example:
>
> In addition to installing the artifacts identified by the coordinates you supply, all of the artifacts\' dependencies are also installed.
>
> To uninstall a dependency, use the uninstall command. As with the install command, it takes one or more sets of artifact coordinates in the format of group:artifact:version, as shown in the following example:
>
> It uninstalls the artifacts identified by the coordinates you supply and their dependencies.
>
> To uninstall all additional dependencies, you can use the \--all option, as shown in the following example:

## Developing Applications with the Groovy Beans DSL

> Spring Framework 4.0 has native support for a beans{} "DSL" (borrowed from Grails), and you can embed bean definitions in your Groovy application scripts by using the same format. This is sometimes a good way to include external features like middleware declarations, as shown in the following example:
>
> You can mix class declarations with beans{} in the same file as long as they stay at the top level, or, if you prefer, you can put the beans DSL in a separate file.

## Configuring the CLI with settings.xml

> The Spring Boot CLI uses Aether, Maven's dependency resolution engine, to resolve dependencies. The CLI makes use of the Maven configuration found in \~/.m2/settings.xml to configure Aether. The following configuration settings are honored by the CLI:

-   Offline

-   Mirrors

-   Servers

-   Proxies

-   Profiles

    -   Activation

    -   Repositories

-   Active profiles

> See Maven's settings documentation for further information.

## What to Read Next

> There are some sample groovy scripts available from the GitHub repository that you can use to try out the Spring Boot CLI. There is also extensive Javadoc throughout the source code.
>
> If you find that you reach the limit of the CLI tool, you probably want to look at converting your application to a full Gradle or Maven built "Groovy project". The next section covers Spring Boot's \"[Build tool plugins](\l)\", which you can use with Gradle or Maven.

# Chapter 11. Build Tool Plugins

> Spring Boot provides build tool plugins for Maven and Gradle. The plugins offer a variety of features, including the packaging of executable jars. This section provides more details on both plugins as well as some help should you need to extend an unsupported build system. If you are just getting started, you might want to read "[Build Systems](\l)" from the "[Developing with Spring Boot](\l)" section first.

## Spring Boot Maven Plugin

> The Spring Boot Maven Plugin provides Spring Boot support in Maven, letting you package executable jar or war archives and run an application "in-place". To use it, you must use Maven 3.2 (or later).
>
> Please refer to the plugin's documentation to learn more:

-   Reference (HTML and PDF)

-   API

## Spring Boot Gradle Plugin

> The Spring Boot Gradle Plugin provides Spring Boot support in Gradle, letting you package executable jar or war archives, run Spring Boot applications, and use the dependency management provided by spring-boot-dependencies. It requires Gradle 6.8, 6.9, or 7.x. Please refer to the plugin's documentation to learn more:

-   Reference (HTML and PDF)

-   API

## Spring Boot AntLib Module

> The Spring Boot AntLib module provides basic Spring Boot support for Apache Ant. You can use the module to create executable jars. To use the module, you need to declare an additional spring-boot namespace in your build.xml, as shown in the following example:
>
> You need to remember to start Ant using the -lib option, as shown in the following example:

##### TIP

> The "Using Spring Boot" section includes a more complete example of [using Apache](\l) [Ant with](\l) [spring-boot-antlib](\l).

1.  **Spring Boot Ant Tasks**

> Once the spring-boot-antlib namespace has been declared, the following additional tasks are available:

-   [Using the "exejar" Task](\l)

-   [Using the "findmainclass" Task](\l)

##### Using the "exejar" Task

> You can use the exejar task to create a Spring Boot executable jar. The following attributes are supported by the task:

--------------- ---------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Attribute**   **Description**                          **Required**

  destfile        The destination jar file to create       Yes

  classes         The root directory of Java class files   Yes

  start-class     The main application class to run        No *(the default is the first class found that declares a* main *method)*
--------------- ---------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

> The following nested elements can be used with the task:

-------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Element**    **Description**

  resources      One or more Resource Collections describing a set of Resources that should be added to the content of the created jar file.

  lib            One or more Resource Collections that should be added to the set of jar libraries that make up the runtime dependency classpath of the application.
-------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Examples

> This section shows two examples of Ant tasks.
>
> *Specify start-class*
>
> *Detect start-class*

### Using the "findmainclass" Task

> The findmainclass task is used internally by exejar to locate a class declaring a main. If necessary, you can also use this task directly in your build. The following attributes are supported:

+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| **Attribute** | **Description**                                     | **Required**                                |
+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| classesroot   | The root directory of Java class files              | Yes *(unless* mainclass *is specified)*     |
+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| mainclass     | Can be used to short-circuit the main               | No                                          |
|               |                                                     |                                             |
|               | class search                                        |                                             |
+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| property      | The Ant property that should be set with the result | No *(result will be logged if unspecified)* |
+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+

##### Examples

> This section contains three examples of using findmainclass.
>
> *Find and log*
>
> *Find and set*
>
> *Override and set*

## Supporting Other Build Systems

> If you want to use a build tool other than Maven, Gradle, or Ant, you likely need to develop your own plugin. Executable jars need to follow a specific format and certain entries need to be written in an uncompressed form (see the "[executable jar format](\l)" section in the appendix for details).
>
> The Spring Boot Maven and Gradle plugins both make use of spring-boot-loader-tools to actually generate jars. If you need to, you may use this library directly.

### Repackaging Archives

> To repackage an existing archive so that it becomes a self-contained executable archive, use org.springframework.boot.loader.tools.Repackager. The Repackager class takes a single constructor argument that refers to an existing jar or war archive. Use one of the two available repackage() methods to either replace the original file or write to a new destination. Various settings can also be configured on the repackager before it is run.

### Nested Libraries

> When repackaging an archive, you can include references to dependency files by using the org.springframework.boot.loader.tools.Libraries interface. We do not provide any concrete implementations of Libraries here as they are usually build-system-specific.
>
> If your archive already includes libraries, you can use Libraries.NONE.

### Finding a Main Class

> If you do not use Repackager.setMainClass() to specify a main class, the repackager uses ASM to read class files and tries to find a suitable class with a public static void main(String\[\] args) method. An exception is thrown if more than one candidate is found.

### Example Repackage Implementation

> The following example shows a typical repackage implementation:

## What to Read Next

> If you are interested in how the build tool plugins work, you can look at the spring-boot-tools
>
> module on GitHub. More technical details of the executable jar format are covered in [the appendix](\l). If you have specific build-related questions, you can check out the "[how-to](\l)" guides.

# Chapter 12. "How-to" Guides

> This section provides answers to some common 'how do I do that...' questions that often arise when using Spring Boot. Its coverage is not exhaustive, but it does cover quite a lot.
>
> If you have a specific problem that we do not cover here, you might want to check out stackoverflow.com to see if someone has already provided an answer. This is also a great place to ask new questions (please use the spring-boot tag).
>
> We are also more than happy to extend this section. If you want to add a 'how-to', send us a pull request.

## Spring Boot Application

> This section includes topics relating directly to Spring Boot applications.

### Create Your Own FailureAnalyzer

> FailureAnalyzer is a great way to intercept an exception on startup and turn it into a human- readable message, wrapped in a FailureAnalysis. Spring Boot provides such an analyzer for application-context-related exceptions, JSR-303 validations, and more. You can also create your own.
>
> AbstractFailureAnalyzer is a convenient extension of FailureAnalyzer that checks the presence of a specified exception type in the exception to handle. You can extend from that so that your implementation gets a chance to handle the exception only when it is actually present. If, for whatever reason, you cannot handle the exception, return null to give another implementation a chance to handle the exception.
>
> FailureAnalyzer implementations must be registered in META-INF/spring.factories. The following example registers ProjectConstraintViolationFailureAnalyzer:

##### NOTE

> If you need access to the BeanFactory or the Environment, your FailureAnalyzer can implement BeanFactoryAware or EnvironmentAware respectively.

### Troubleshoot Auto-configuration

> The Spring Boot auto-configuration tries its best to "do the right thing", but sometimes things fail, and it can be hard to tell why.
>
> There is a really useful ConditionEvaluationReport available in any Spring Boot ApplicationContext. You can see it if you enable DEBUG logging output. If you use the spring-boot-actuator (see [the](\l) [Actuator chapter](\l)), there is also a conditions endpoint that renders the report in JSON. Use that endpoint to debug the application and see what features have been added (and which have not
>
> been added) by Spring Boot at runtime.
>
> Many more questions can be answered by looking at the source code and the Javadoc. When reading the code, remember the following rules of thumb:

-   Look for classes called \*AutoConfiguration and read their sources. Pay special attention to the \@Conditional\* annotations to find out what features they enable and when. Add \--debug to the command line or a System property -Ddebug to get a log on the console of all the auto- configuration decisions that were made in your app. In a running application with actuator enabled, look at the conditions endpoint (/actuator/conditions or the JMX equivalent) for the same information.

-   Look for classes that are \@ConfigurationProperties (such as ServerProperties) and read from there the available external configuration options. The \@ConfigurationProperties annotation has a name attribute that acts as a prefix to external properties. Thus, ServerProperties has prefix=\"server\" and its configuration properties are server.port, server.address, and others. In a running application with actuator enabled, look at the configprops endpoint.

-   Look for uses of the bind method on the Binder to pull configuration values explicitly out of the

> Environment in a relaxed manner. It is often used with a prefix.

-   Look for \@Value annotations that bind directly to the Environment.

-   Look for \@ConditionalOnExpression annotations that switch features on and off in response to SpEL expressions, normally evaluated with placeholders resolved from the Environment.

### Customize the Environment or ApplicationContext Before It Starts

> A SpringApplication has ApplicationListeners and ApplicationContextInitializers that are used to apply customizations to the context or environment. Spring Boot loads a number of such customizations for use internally from META-INF/spring.factories. There is more than one way to register additional customizations:

-   Programmatically, per application, by calling the addListeners and addInitializers methods on

> SpringApplication before you run it.

-   Declaratively, per application, by setting the context.initializer.classes or

> context.listener.classes properties.

-   Declaratively, for all applications, by adding a META-INF/spring.factories and packaging a jar file that the applications all use as a library.

> The SpringApplication sends some special ApplicationEvents to the listeners (some even before the context is created) and then registers the listeners for events published by the ApplicationContext as well. See "[Application Events and Listeners](\l)" in the 'Spring Boot features' section for a complete list.
>
> It is also possible to customize the Environment before the application context is refreshed by using EnvironmentPostProcessor. Each implementation should be registered in META-INF/spring.factories, as shown in the following example:
>
> The implementation can load arbitrary files and add them to the Environment. For instance, the following example loads a YAML configuration file from the classpath:

#### import java.io.IOException;

> import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
>
> import org.springframework.boot.env.EnvironmentPostProcessor; import org.springframework.boot.env.YamlPropertySourceLoader; import org.springframework.core.env.ConfigurableEnvironment; import org.springframework.core.env.PropertySource;
>
> import org.springframework.core.io.ClassPathResource; import org.springframework.core.io.Resource;
>
> import org.springframework.util.Assert;
>
> public class MyEnvironmentPostProcessor implements EnvironmentPostProcessor { private final YamlPropertySourceLoader loader = new YamlPropertySourceLoader(); \@Override
>
> public void postProcessEnvironment(ConfigurableEnvironment environment, SpringApplication application) {
>
> Resource path = new ClassPathResource(\"com/example/myapp/config.yml\"); PropertySource\<?> propertySource = loadYaml(path); environment.getPropertySources().addLast(propertySource);
>
> }
>
> private PropertySource\<?> loadYaml(Resource path) { Assert.isTrue(path.exists(), () -\> \"Resource \" + path + \" does not exist\"); try {
>
> return this.loader.load(\"custom-resource\", path).get(0);
>
> }
>
> catch (IOException ex) {
>
> throw new IllegalStateException(\"Failed to load yaml configuration from \"
>
> \+ path, ex);
>
> }
>
> }
>
> }

##### TIP

> The Environment has already been prepared with all the usual property sources that Spring Boot loads by default. It is therefore possible to get the location of the file from the environment. The preceding example adds the custom-resource property source at the end of the list so that a key defined in any of the usual other locations takes precedence. A custom implementation may define another order.

##### CAUTION

> While using \@PropertySource on your \@SpringBootApplication may seem to be a convenient way to load a custom resource in the Environment, we do not recommend it. Such property sources are not added to the Environment until the application context is being refreshed. This is too late to configure certain properties such as logging.\* and spring.main.\* which are read before refresh begins.

### Build an ApplicationContext Hierarchy (Adding a Parent or Root Context)

> You can use the ApplicationBuilder class to create parent/child ApplicationContext hierarchies. See "[Fluent Builder API](\l)" in the 'Spring Boot features' section for more information.

### Create a Non-web Application

> Not all Spring applications have to be web applications (or web services). If you want to execute some code in a main method but also bootstrap a Spring application to set up the infrastructure to use, you can use the SpringApplication features of Spring Boot. A SpringApplication changes its ApplicationContext class, depending on whether it thinks it needs a web application or not. The first thing you can do to help it is to leave server-related dependencies (e.g. servlet API) off the classpath. If you cannot do that (for example, you run two applications from the same code base) then you can explicitly call setWebApplicationType(WebApplicationType.NONE) on your SpringApplication instance or set the applicationContextClass property (through the Java API or with external properties). Application code that you want to run as your business logic can be implemented as a CommandLineRunner and dropped into the context as a \@Bean definition.

## Properties and Configuration

> This section includes topics about setting and reading properties and configuration settings and their interaction with Spring Boot applications.

### Automatically Expand Properties at Build Time

> Rather than hardcoding some properties that are also specified in your project's build configuration, you can automatically expand them by instead using the existing build configuration. This is possible in both Maven and Gradle.

##### Automatic Property Expansion Using Maven

> You can automatically expand properties from the Maven project by using resource filtering. If you use the spring-boot-starter-parent, you can then refer to your Maven 'project properties' with @..@ placeholders, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### NOTE

> Only production configuration is filtered that way (in other words, no filtering is applied on src/test/resources).

##### TIP

> If you enable the addResources flag, the spring-boot:run goal can add src/main/resources directly to the classpath (for hot reloading purposes). Doing so circumvents the resource filtering and this feature. Instead, you can use the exec:java goal or customize the plugin's configuration. See the plugin usage page for more details.
>
> If you do not use the starter parent, you need to include the following element inside the \<build/>
>
> element of your pom.xml:
>
> You also need to include the following element inside \<plugins/>:

##### NOTE

> The useDefaultDelimiters property is important if you use standard Spring placeholders (such as \${placeholder}) in your configuration. If that property is not set to false, these may be expanded by the build.

##### Automatic Property Expansion Using Gradle

> You can automatically expand properties from the Gradle project by configuring the Java plugin's
>
> processResources task to do so, as shown in the following example:
>
> You can then refer to your Gradle project's properties by using placeholders, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### NOTE

> Gradle's expand method uses Groovy's SimpleTemplateEngine, which transforms \${..} tokens. The \${..} style conflicts with Spring's own property placeholder mechanism. To use Spring property placeholders together with automatic expansion, escape the Spring property placeholders as follows: \\\${..}.

### Externalize the Configuration of SpringApplication

> A SpringApplication has bean property setters, so you can use its Java API as you create the application to modify its behavior. Alternatively, you can externalize the configuration by setting properties in spring.main.\*. For example, in application.properties, you might have the following settings:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> Then the Spring Boot banner is not printed on startup, and the application is not starting an embedded web server.
>
> Properties defined in external configuration override and replace the values specified with the Java API, with the notable exception of the primary sources. Primary sources are those provided to the SpringApplication constructor:
>
> Or to sources(...) method of a SpringApplicationBuilder:
>
> Given the examples above, if we have the following configuration:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> The actual application will show the banner (as overridden by configuration) and uses three sources for the ApplicationContext. The application sources are:

1.  MyApplication (from the code)

2.  MyDatabaseConfig (from the external config)

3.  MyJmsConfig(from the external config)

    1.  ### Change the Location of External Properties of an Application

> By default, properties from different sources are added to the Spring Environment in a defined order (see "[Externalized Configuration](\l)" in the 'Spring Boot features' section for the exact order).
>
> You can also provide the following System properties (or environment variables) to change the behavior:

-   spring.config.name (SPRING_CONFIG_NAME): Defaults to application as the root of the file name.

-   spring.config.location (SPRING_CONFIG_LOCATION): The file to load (such as a classpath resource or a URL). A separate Environment property source is set up for this document and it can be overridden by system properties, environment variables, or the command line.

> No matter what you set in the environment, Spring Boot always loads application.properties as described above. By default, if YAML is used, then files with the '.yml' extension are also added to the list.
>
> Spring Boot logs the configuration files that are loaded at the DEBUG level and the candidates it has not found at TRACE level.
>
> See ConfigFileApplicationListener for more detail.

### Use 'Short' Command Line Arguments

> Some people like to use (for example) \--port=9000 instead of \--server.port=9000 to set configuration properties on the command line. You can enable this behavior by using placeholders in application.properties, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### TIP

> If you inherit from the spring-boot-starter-parent POM, the default filter token of the maven-resources-plugins has been changed from \${\*} to @ (that is, \@maven.token@ instead of \${maven.token}) to prevent conflicts with Spring-style placeholders. If you have enabled Maven filtering for the application.properties directly, you may want to also change the default filter token to use other delimiters.

##### NOTE

> In this specific case, the port binding works in a PaaS environment such as Heroku or Cloud Foundry. In those two platforms, the PORT environment variable is set automatically and Spring can bind to capitalized synonyms for Environment properties.

### Use YAML for External Properties

> YAML is a superset of JSON and, as such, is a convenient syntax for storing external properties in a hierarchical format, as shown in the following example:
>
> Create a file called application.yml and put it in the root of your classpath. Then add snakeyaml to your dependencies (Maven coordinates org.yaml:snakeyaml, already included if you use the spring- boot-starter). A YAML file is parsed to a Java Map\<String,Object> (like a JSON object), and Spring Boot flattens the map so that it is one level deep and has period-separated keys, as many people are used to with Properties files in Java.
>
> The preceding example YAML corresponds to the following application.properties file:
>
> See "[Working with YAML](\l)" in the 'Spring Boot features' section for more information about YAML.

### Set the Active Spring Profiles

> The Spring Environment has an API for this, but you would normally set a System property (spring.profiles.active) or an OS environment variable (SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE). Also, you can launch your application with a -D argument (remember to put it before the main class or jar archive), as follows:
>
> In Spring Boot, you can also set the active profile in application.properties, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> A value set this way is replaced by the System property or environment variable setting but not by the SpringApplicationBuilder.profiles() method. Thus, the latter Java API can be used to augment the profiles without changing the defaults.
>
> See "[Profiles](\l)" in the "Spring Boot features" section for more information.

### Set the Default Profile Name

> The default profile is a profile that is enabled if no profile is active. By default, the name of the default profile is default, but it could be changed using a System property (spring.profiles.default) or an OS environment variable (SPRING_PROFILES_DEFAULT).
>
> In Spring Boot, you can also set the default profile name in application.properties, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> See "[Profiles](\l)" in the "Spring Boot features" section for more information.

### Change Configuration Depending on the Environment

> Spring Boot supports multi-document YAML and Properties files (see [Working with Multi-Document](\l) [Files](\l) for details) which can be activated conditionally based on the active profiles.
>
> If a document contains a spring.config.activate.on-profile key, then the profiles value (a comma- separated list of profiles or a profile expression) is fed into the Spring Environment.acceptsProfiles() method. If the profile expression matches then that document is included in the final merge (otherwise, it is not), as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> In the preceding example, the default port is 9000. However, if the Spring profile called 'development' is active, then the port is 9001. If 'production' is active, then the port is 0.
>
> **NOTE** The documents are merged in the order in which they are encountered. Later values override earlier values.

### Discover Built-in Options for External Properties

> Spring Boot binds external properties from application.properties (or .yml files and other places) into an application at runtime. There is not (and technically cannot be) an exhaustive list of all supported properties in a single location, because contributions can come from additional jar files on your classpath.
>
> A running application with the Actuator features has a configprops endpoint that shows all the bound and bindable properties available through \@ConfigurationProperties.
>
> The appendix includes an [application.properties](\l) example with a list of the most common properties supported by Spring Boot. The definitive list comes from searching the source code for \@ConfigurationProperties and \@Value annotations as well as the occasional use of Binder. For more about the exact ordering of loading properties, see \"[Externalized Configuration](\l)\".

## Embedded Web Servers

> Each Spring Boot web application includes an embedded web server. This feature leads to a number of how-to questions, including how to change the embedded server and how to configure the embedded server. This section answers those questions.

### Use Another Web Server

> Many Spring Boot starters include default embedded containers.

-   For servlet stack applications, the spring-boot-starter-web includes Tomcat by including spring- boot-starter-tomcat, but you can use spring-boot-starter-jetty or spring-boot-starter- undertow instead.

-   For reactive stack applications, the spring-boot-starter-webflux includes Reactor Netty by including spring-boot-starter-reactor-netty, but you can use spring-boot-starter-tomcat, spring-boot-starter-jetty, or spring-boot-starter-undertow instead.

> When switching to a different HTTP server, you need to swap the default dependencies for those that you need instead. To help with this process, Spring Boot provides a separate starter for each of the supported HTTP servers.
>
> The following Maven example shows how to exclude Tomcat and include Jetty for Spring MVC:

##### NOTE

> The version of the Servlet API has been overridden as, unlike Tomcat 9 and Undertow 2, Jetty 9.4 does not support Servlet 4.0. If you wish to use Jetty 10, which does support Servlet 4.0, override the jetty.version property rather than the servlet-api.version property.
>
> The following Gradle example configures the necessary dependencies and a module replacement to use Undertow in place of Reactor Netty for Spring WebFlux:

##### NOTE

> spring-boot-starter-reactor-netty is required to use the WebClient class, so you may need to keep a dependency on Netty even when you need to include a different HTTP server.

### Disabling the Web Server

> If your classpath contains the necessary bits to start a web server, Spring Boot will automatically start it. To disable this behavior configure the WebApplicationType in your application.properties, as
>
> shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*

### Change the HTTP Port

> In a standalone application, the main HTTP port defaults to 8080 but can be set with server.port (for example, in application.properties or as a System property). Thanks to relaxed binding of Environment values, you can also use SERVER_PORT (for example, as an OS environment variable).
>
> To switch off the HTTP endpoints completely but still create a WebApplicationContext, use
>
> server.port=-1 (doing so is sometimes useful for testing).
>
> For more details, see "[Customizing Embedded Servlet Containers](\l)" in the 'Spring Boot Features' section, or the ServerProperties source code.

### Use a Random Unassigned HTTP Port

> To scan for a free port (using OS natives to prevent clashes) use server.port=0.

### Discover the HTTP Port at Runtime

> You can access the port the server is running on from log output or from the WebServerApplicationContext through its WebServer. The best way to get that and be sure it has been initialized is to add a \@Bean of type ApplicationListener\<WebServerInitializedEvent> and pull the container out of the event when it is published.
>
> Tests that use \@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment=WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT) can also inject the actual port into a field by using the \@LocalServerPort annotation, as shown in the following example:

##### NOTE

> \@LocalServerPort is a meta-annotation for \@Value(\"\${local.server.port}\"). Do not try to inject the port in a regular application. As we just saw, the value is set only after the container has been initialized. Contrary to a test, application code callbacks are processed early (before the value is actually available).

### Enable HTTP Response Compression

> HTTP response compression is supported by Jetty, Tomcat, and Undertow. It can be enabled in
>
> application.properties, as follows:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> By default, responses must be at least 2048 bytes in length for compression to be performed. You can configure this behavior by setting the server.compression.min-response-size property.
>
> By default, responses are compressed only if their content type is one of the following:

-   text/html

-   text/xml

-   text/plain

-   text/css

-   text/javascript

-   application/javascript

-   application/json

-   application/xml

> You can configure this behavior by setting the server.compression.mime-types property.

### Configure SSL

> SSL can be configured declaratively by setting the various server.ssl.\* properties, typically in application.properties or application.yml. The following example shows setting SSL properties in application.properties:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> See Ssl for details of all of the supported properties.
>
> Using configuration such as the preceding example means the application no longer supports a plain HTTP connector at port 8080. Spring Boot does not support the configuration of both an HTTP connector and an HTTPS connector through application.properties. If you want to have both, you need to configure one of them programmatically. We recommend using application.properties to configure HTTPS, as the HTTP connector is the easier of the two to configure programmatically.

### Configure HTTP/2

> You can enable HTTP/2 support in your Spring Boot application with the server.http2.enabled configuration property. Both h2 (HTTP/2 over TLS) and h2c (HTTP/2 over TCP) are supported. To use h2, SSL must also be enabled. When SSL is not enabled, h2c will be used. The details of the h2 support depend on the chosen web server and the application environment, since that protocol is not supported out-of-the-box by all JDK 8 releases.

##### HTTP/2 with Tomcat

> Spring Boot ships by default with Tomcat 9.0.x which supports h2c out of the box and h2 out of the box when using JDK 9 or later. Alternatively, h2 can be used on JDK 8 if the libtcnative library and its dependencies are installed on the host operating system.
>
> The library directory must be made available, if not already, to the JVM library path. You can do so with a JVM argument such as -Djava.library.path=/usr/local/opt/tomcat-native/lib. More on this in the official Tomcat documentation.
>
> Starting Tomcat 9.0.x on JDK 8 with HTTP/2 and SSL enabled but without that native support logs the following error:
>
> This error is not fatal, and the application still starts with HTTP/1.1 SSL support.

##### HTTP/2 with Jetty

> For HTTP/2 support, Jetty requires the additional org.eclipse.jetty.http2:http2-server dependency. To use h2c no other dependencies are required. To use h2, you also need to choose one of the following dependencies, depending on your deployment:

-   org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-alpn-java-server for applications running on JDK9+

-   org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-alpn-openjdk8-server for applications running on JDK8u252+

-   org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-alpn-conscrypt-server and the Conscrypt library with no JDK requirement

##### HTTP/2 with Reactor Netty

> The spring-boot-webflux-starter is using by default Reactor Netty as a server. Reactor Netty supports h2c using JDK 8 or later with no additional dependencies. Reactor Netty supports h2 using the JDK support with JDK 9 or later. For JDK 8 environments, or for optimal runtime performance, this server also supports h2 with native libraries. To enable that, your application needs to have an additional dependency.
>
> Spring Boot manages the version for the io.netty:netty-tcnative-boringssl-static \"uber jar\", containing native libraries for all platforms. Developers can choose to import only the required dependencies using a classifier (see the Netty official documentation).

##### HTTP/2 with Undertow

> As of Undertow 1.4.0+, both h2 and h2c are supported on JDK 8 without any additional dependencies.

### Configure the Web Server

> Generally, you should first consider using one of the many available configuration keys and customize your web server by adding new entries in your application.properties (or application.yml, or environment, etc. see "[Discover Built-in Options for External Properties](\l)"). The server.\* namespace is quite useful here, and it includes namespaces like server.tomcat.\*,
>
> server.jetty.\* and others, for server-specific features. See the list of [Common Application](\l) [Properties](\l).
>
> The previous sections covered already many common use cases, such as compression, SSL or HTTP/2. However, if a configuration key doesn't exist for your use case, you should then look at WebServerFactoryCustomizer. You can declare such a component and get access to the server factory relevant to your choice: you should select the variant for the chosen Server (Tomcat, Jetty, Reactor Netty, Undertow) and the chosen web stack (Servlet or Reactive).
>
> The example below is for Tomcat with the spring-boot-starter-web (Servlet stack):

##### NOTE

> Spring Boot uses that infrastructure internally to auto-configure the server. Auto- configured WebServerFactoryCustomizer beans have an order of 0 and will be processed before any user-defined customizers, unless it has an explicit order that states otherwise.
>
> Once you've got access to a WebServerFactory using the customizer, you can use it to configure specific parts, like connectors, server resources, or the server itself - all using server-specific APIs.
>
> In addition Spring Boot provides:

-------------- --------------------------------- ----------------------------------
  **Server**     **Servlet stack**                 **Reactive stack**

  Tomcat         TomcatServletWebServerFactory     TomcatReactiveWebServerFactory

  Jetty          JettyServletWebServerFactory      JettyReactiveWebServerFactory

  Undertow       UndertowServletWebServerFactory   UndertowReactiveWebServerFactory

  Reactor        N/A                               NettyReactiveWebServerFactory
-------------- --------------------------------- ----------------------------------

> As a last resort, you can also declare your own WebServerFactory bean, which will override the one provided by Spring Boot. When you do so, auto-configured customizers are still applied on your custom factory, so use that option carefully.

### Add a Servlet, Filter, or Listener to an Application

> In a servlet stack application, i.e. with the spring-boot-starter-web, there are two ways to add Servlet, Filter, ServletContextListener, and the other listeners supported by the Servlet API to your application:

-   [Add a Servlet, Filter, or Listener by Using a Spring Bean](\l)

-   [Add Servlets, Filters, and Listeners by Using Classpath Scanning](\l)

##### Add a Servlet, Filter, or Listener by Using a Spring Bean

> To add a Servlet, Filter, or Servlet \*Listener by using a Spring bean, you must provide a \@Bean definition for it. Doing so can be very useful when you want to inject configuration or dependencies. However, you must be very careful that they do not cause eager initialization of too many other beans, because they have to be installed in the container very early in the application lifecycle. (For example, it is not a good idea to have them depend on your DataSource or JPA configuration.) You can work around such restrictions by initializing the beans lazily when first used instead of on initialization.
>
> In the case of Filters and Servlets, you can also add mappings and init parameters by adding a FilterRegistrationBean or a ServletRegistrationBean instead of or in addition to the underlying component.
>
> **NOTE** If no dispatcherType is specified on a filter registration, REQUEST is used. This aligns with the Servlet Specification's default dispatcher type.
>
> Like any other Spring bean, you can define the order of Servlet filter beans; please make sure to check the "[Registering Servlets, Filters, and Listeners as Spring Beans](\l)" section.
>
> **Disable Registration of a Servlet or Filter**
>
> As [described earlier](\l), any Servlet or Filter beans are registered with the servlet container automatically. To disable registration of a particular Filter or Servlet bean, create a registration bean for it and mark it as disabled, as shown in the following example:

##### Add Servlets, Filters, and Listeners by Using Classpath Scanning

> \@WebServlet, \@WebFilter, and \@WebListener annotated classes can be automatically registered with an embedded servlet container by annotating a \@Configuration class with \@ServletComponentScan and specifying the package(s) containing the components that you want to register. By default, \@ServletComponentScan scans from the package of the annotated class.

### Configure Access Logging

> Access logs can be configured for Tomcat, Undertow, and Jetty through their respective namespaces.
>
> For instance, the following settings log access on Tomcat with a custom pattern.
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### NOTE

> The default location for logs is a logs directory relative to the Tomcat base directory. By default, the logs directory is a temporary directory, so you may want to fix Tomcat's base directory or use an absolute path for the logs. In the preceding example, the logs are available in my-tomcat/logs relative to the working directory of the application.
>
> Access logging for Undertow can be configured in a similar fashion, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> Logs are stored in a logs directory relative to the working directory of the application. You can customize this location by setting the server.undertow.accesslog.dir property.
>
> Finally, access logging for Jetty can also be configured as follows:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> By default, logs are redirected to System.err. For more details, see the Jetty documentation.

### Running Behind a Front-end Proxy Server

> If your application is running behind a proxy, a load-balancer or in the cloud, the request information (like the host, port, scheme...) might change along the way. Your application may be running on 10.10.10.10:8080, but HTTP clients should only see example.org.
>
> RFC7239 \"Forwarded Headers\" defines the Forwarded HTTP header; proxies can use this header to provide information about the original request. You can configure your application to read those headers and automatically use that information when creating links and sending them to clients in HTTP 302 responses, JSON documents or HTML pages. There are also non-standard headers, like X- Forwarded-Host, X-Forwarded-Port, X-Forwarded-Proto, X-Forwarded-Ssl, and X-Forwarded-Prefix.
>
> If the proxy adds the commonly used X-Forwarded-For and X-Forwarded-Proto headers, setting server.forward-headers-strategy to NATIVE is enough to support those. With this option, the Web servers themselves natively support this feature; you can check their specific documentation to learn about specific behavior.
>
> If this is not enough, Spring Framework provides a ForwardedHeaderFilter. You can register it as a Servlet Filter in your application by setting server.forward-headers-strategy is set to FRAMEWORK.

##### TIP

> If you are using Tomcat and terminating SSL at the proxy, server.tomcat.redirect- context-root should be set to false. This allows the X-Forwarded-Proto header to be honored before any redirects are performed.

##### NOTE

> If your application runs in Cloud Foundry or Heroku, the server.forward-headers- strategy property defaults to NATIVE. In all other instances, it defaults to NONE.

##### Customize Tomcat's Proxy Configuration

> If you use Tomcat, you can additionally configure the names of the headers used to carry "forwarded" information, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> Tomcat is also configured with a default regular expression that matches internal proxies that are to be trusted. By default, IP addresses in 10/8, 192.168/16, 169.254/16 and 127/8 are trusted. You can customize the valve's configuration by adding an entry to application.properties, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### NOTE

> You can trust all proxies by setting the internal-proxies to empty (but do not do so in production).
>
> You can take complete control of the configuration of Tomcat's RemoteIpValve by switching the automatic one off (to do so, set server.forward-headers-strategy=NONE) and adding a new valve instance using a WebServerFactoryCustomizer bean.

### Enable Multiple Connectors with Tomcat

> You can add an org.apache.catalina.connector.Connector to the TomcatServletWebServerFactory, which can allow multiple connectors, including HTTP and HTTPS connectors, as shown in the following example:

#### import java.io.IOException; import java.net.URL;

> import org.apache.catalina.connector.Connector; import org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol;
>
> import org.springframework.boot.web.embedded.tomcat.TomcatServletWebServerFactory; import org.springframework.boot.web.server.WebServerFactoryCustomizer;
>
> import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
>
> import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration; import org.springframework.util.ResourceUtils;
>
> \@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false) public class MyTomcatConfiguration {
>
> \@Bean
>
> public WebServerFactoryCustomizer\<TomcatServletWebServerFactory> sslConnectorCustomizer() {
>
> return (tomcat) -\> tomcat.addAdditionalTomcatConnectors(createSslConnector());
>
> }
>
> private Connector createSslConnector() { Connector connector = new
>
> Connector(\"org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol\"); Http11NioProtocol protocol = (Http11NioProtocol)
>
> connector.getProtocolHandler(); try {
>
> URL keystore = ResourceUtils.getURL(\"keystore\");
>
> URL truststore = ResourceUtils.getURL(\"truststore\"); connector.setScheme(\"https\"); connector.setSecure(true);
>
> connector.setPort(8443); protocol.setSSLEnabled(true); protocol.setKeystoreFile(keystore.toString()); protocol.setKeystorePass(\"changeit\"); protocol.setTruststoreFile(truststore.toString()); protocol.setTruststorePass(\"changeit\"); protocol.setKeyAlias(\"apitester\");
>
> return connector;
>
> }
>
> catch (IOException ex) {
>
> throw new IllegalStateException(\"Fail to create ssl connector\", ex);
>
> }
>
> }
>
> }

14. **Use Tomcat's LegacyCookieProcessor**

> By default, the embedded Tomcat used by Spring Boot does not support \"Version 0\" of the Cookie format, so you may see the following error:
>
> If at all possible, you should consider updating your code to only store values compliant with later Cookie specifications. If, however, you cannot change the way that cookies are written, you can instead configure Tomcat to use a LegacyCookieProcessor. To switch to the LegacyCookieProcessor, use an WebServerFactoryCustomizer bean that adds a TomcatContextCustomizer, as shown in the following example:

#### import org.apache.tomcat.util.http.LegacyCookieProcessor;

> import org.springframework.boot.web.embedded.tomcat.TomcatServletWebServerFactory; import org.springframework.boot.web.server.WebServerFactoryCustomizer;
>
> import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
>
> import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
>
> \@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
>
> public class MyLegacyCookieProcessorConfiguration {
>
> \@Bean
>
> public WebServerFactoryCustomizer\<TomcatServletWebServerFactory> cookieProcessorCustomizer() {
>
> return (factory) -\> factory
>
> .addContextCustomizers((context) -\> context.setCookieProcessor(new LegacyCookieProcessor()));
>
> }
>
> }

15. **Enable Tomcat's MBean Registry**

> Embedded Tomcat's MBean registry is disabled by default. This minimizes Tomcat's memory footprint. If you want to use Tomcat's MBeans, for example so that they can be used to expose metrics via Micrometer, you must use the server.tomcat.mbeanregistry.enabled property to do so, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

### Enable Multiple Listeners with Undertow

> Add an UndertowBuilderCustomizer to the UndertowServletWebServerFactory and add a listener to the
>
> Builder, as shown in the following example:

#### import io.undertow.Undertow.Builder;

> import org.springframework.boot.web.embedded.undertow.UndertowServletWebServerFactory; import org.springframework.boot.web.server.WebServerFactoryCustomizer;
>
> import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
>
> import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
>
> \@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false) public class MyUndertowConfiguration {
>
> \@Bean
>
> public WebServerFactoryCustomizer\<UndertowServletWebServerFactory> undertowListenerCustomizer() {
>
> return (factory) -\> factory.addBuilderCustomizers(this::addHttpListener);
>
> }
>
> private Builder addHttpListener(Builder builder) { return builder.addHttpListener(8080, \"0.0.0.0\");
>
> }
>
> }

### Create WebSocket Endpoints Using \@ServerEndpoint

> If you want to use \@ServerEndpoint in a Spring Boot application that used an embedded container, you must declare a single ServerEndpointExporter \@Bean, as shown in the following example:
>
> The bean shown in the preceding example registers any \@ServerEndpoint annotated beans with the underlying WebSocket container. When deployed to a standalone servlet container, this role is performed by a servlet container initializer, and the ServerEndpointExporter bean is not required.

## Spring MVC

> Spring Boot has a number of starters that include Spring MVC. Note that some starters include a dependency on Spring MVC rather than include it directly. This section answers common questions about Spring MVC and Spring Boot.

### Write a JSON REST Service

> Any Spring \@RestController in a Spring Boot application should render JSON response by default as long as Jackson2 is on the classpath, as shown in the following example:
>
> As long as MyThing can be serialized by Jackson2 (true for a normal POJO or Groovy object), then localhost:8080/thing serves a JSON representation of it by default. Note that, in a browser, you might sometimes see XML responses, because browsers tend to send accept headers that prefer XML.

### Write an XML REST Service

> If you have the Jackson XML extension (jackson-dataformat-xml) on the classpath, you can use it to render XML responses. The previous example that we used for JSON would work. To use the Jackson XML renderer, add the following dependency to your project:
>
> If Jackson's XML extension is not available and JAXB is available, XML can be rendered with the additional requirement of having MyThing annotated as \@XmlRootElement, as shown in the following example:
>
> JAXB is only available out of the box with Java 8. If you're using a more recent Java generation, add the following dependency to your project:

##### NOTE

> To get the server to render XML instead of JSON, you might have to send an Accept: text/xml header (or use a browser).

### Customize the Jackson ObjectMapper

> Spring MVC (client and server side) uses HttpMessageConverters to negotiate content conversion in
>
> an HTTP exchange. If Jackson is on the classpath, you already get the default converter(s) provided by Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder, an instance of which is auto-configured for you.
>
> The ObjectMapper (or XmlMapper for Jackson XML converter) instance (created by default) has the following customized properties:

-   MapperFeature.DEFAULT_VIEW_INCLUSION is disabled

-   DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES is disabled

-   SerializationFeature.WRITE_DATES_AS_TIMESTAMPS is disabled

> Spring Boot also has some features to make it easier to customize this behavior.
>
> You can configure the ObjectMapper and XmlMapper instances by using the environment. Jackson provides an extensive suite of on/off features that can be used to configure various aspects of its processing. These features are described in six enums (in Jackson) that map onto properties in the environment:

+-------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| **Enum**                                              | **Property**                                  | **Values**                                           |

>
> This environment-based configuration is applied to the auto-configured Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder bean and applies to any mappers created by using the builder, including the auto-configured ObjectMapper bean.
>
> The context's Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder can be customized by one or more Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilderCustomizer beans. Such customizer beans can be ordered (Boot's own customizer has an order of 0), letting additional customization be applied both before and after Boot's customization.
>
> Any beans of type com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.Module are automatically registered with the auto-configured Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder and are applied to any ObjectMapper instances that it creates. This provides a global mechanism for contributing custom modules when you add new features to your application.
>
> If you want to replace the default ObjectMapper completely, either define a \@Bean of that type and mark it as \@Primary or, if you prefer the builder-based approach, define a Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder \@Bean. Note that, in either case, doing so disables all auto-configuration of the ObjectMapper.
>
> If you provide any \@Beans of type MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter, they replace the default value in the MVC configuration. Also, a convenience bean of type HttpMessageConverters is provided (and is always available if you use the default MVC configuration). It has some useful methods to access the default and user-enhanced message converters.
>
> See the "[Customize the \@ResponseBody Rendering](\l)" section and the WebMvcAutoConfiguration source code for more details.

### Customize the \@ResponseBody Rendering

> Spring uses HttpMessageConverters to render \@ResponseBody (or responses from \@RestController). You can contribute additional converters by adding beans of the appropriate type in a Spring Boot context. If a bean you add is of a type that would have been included by default anyway (such as MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter for JSON conversions), it replaces the default value. A convenience bean of type HttpMessageConverters is provided and is always available if you use the default MVC configuration. It has some useful methods to access the default and user-enhanced message converters (For example, it can be useful if you want to manually inject them into a custom RestTemplate).
>
> As in normal MVC usage, any WebMvcConfigurer beans that you provide can also contribute converters by overriding the configureMessageConverters method. However, unlike with normal MVC, you can supply only additional converters that you need (because Spring Boot uses the same mechanism to contribute its defaults). Finally, if you opt out of the Spring Boot default MVC configuration by providing your own \@EnableWebMvc configuration, you can take control completely and do everything manually by using getMessageConverters from WebMvcConfigurationSupport.
>
> See the WebMvcAutoConfiguration source code for more details.

### Handling Multipart File Uploads

> Spring Boot embraces the Servlet 3 javax.servlet.http.Part API to support uploading files. By default, Spring Boot configures Spring MVC with a maximum size of 1MB per file and a maximum of 10MB of file data in a single request. You may override these values, the location to which intermediate data is stored (for example, to the /tmp directory), and the threshold past which data is flushed to disk by using the properties exposed in the MultipartProperties class. For example, if you want to specify that files be unlimited, set the spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size property to
>
> -1.
>
> The multipart support is helpful when you want to receive multipart encoded file data as a \@RequestParam-annotated parameter of type MultipartFile in a Spring MVC controller handler method.
>
> See the MultipartAutoConfiguration source for more details.

##### NOTE

> It is recommended to use the container's built-in support for multipart uploads rather than introducing an additional dependency such as Apache Commons File Upload.

### Switch Off the Spring MVC DispatcherServlet

> By default, all content is served from the root of your application (/). If you would rather map to a different path, you can configure one as follows:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> If you have additional servlets you can declare a \@Bean of type Servlet or ServletRegistrationBean for each and Spring Boot will register them transparently to the container. Because servlets are registered that way, they can be mapped to a sub-context of the DispatcherServlet without invoking it.
>
> Configuring the DispatcherServlet yourself is unusual but if you really need to do it, a \@Bean of type DispatcherServletPath must be provided as well to provide the path of your custom DispatcherServlet.

### Switch off the Default MVC Configuration

> The easiest way to take complete control over MVC configuration is to provide your own \@Configuration with the \@EnableWebMvc annotation. Doing so leaves all MVC configuration in your hands.

### Customize ViewResolvers

> A ViewResolver is a core component of Spring MVC, translating view names in \@Controller to actual View implementations. Note that ViewResolvers are mainly used in UI applications, rather than REST-style services (a View is not used to render a \@ResponseBody). There are many implementations of ViewResolver to choose from, and Spring on its own is not opinionated about which ones you should use. Spring Boot, on the other hand, installs one or two for you, depending on what it finds on the classpath and in the application context. The DispatcherServlet uses all the resolvers it finds in the application context, trying each one in turn until it gets a result. If you add your own, you have to be aware of the order and in which position your resolver is added.
>
> WebMvcAutoConfiguration adds the following ViewResolvers to your context:

-   An InternalResourceViewResolver named 'defaultViewResolver'. This one locates physical resources that can be rendered by using the DefaultServlet (including static resources and JSP pages, if you use those). It applies a prefix and a suffix to the view name and then looks for a physical resource with that path in the servlet context (the defaults are both empty but are accessible for external configuration through spring.mvc.view.prefix and spring.mvc.view.suffix). You can override it by providing a bean of the same type.

-   A BeanNameViewResolver named 'beanNameViewResolver'. This is a useful member of the view resolver chain and picks up any beans with the same name as the View being resolved. It should not be necessary to override or replace it.

-   A ContentNegotiatingViewResolver named 'viewResolver' is added only if there **are** actually beans of type View present. This is a composite resolver, delegating to all the others and attempting to find a match to the 'Accept' HTTP header sent by the client. There is a useful blog about ContentNegotiatingViewResolver that you might like to study to learn more, and you might also look at the source code for detail. You can switch off the auto-configured ContentNegotiatingViewResolver by defining a bean named 'viewResolver'.

-   If you use Thymeleaf, you also have a ThymeleafViewResolver named 'thymeleafViewResolver'. It looks for resources by surrounding the view name with a prefix and suffix. The prefix is spring.thymeleaf.prefix, and the suffix is spring.thymeleaf.suffix. The values of the prefix and suffix default to 'classpath:/templates/' and '.html', respectively. You can override ThymeleafViewResolver by providing a bean of the same name.

-   If you use FreeMarker, you also have a FreeMarkerViewResolver named 'freeMarkerViewResolver'. It looks for resources in a loader path (which is externalized to spring.freemarker.templateLoaderPath and has a default value of 'classpath:/templates/') by surrounding the view name with a prefix and a suffix. The prefix is externalized to spring.freemarker.prefix, and the suffix is externalized to spring.freemarker.suffix. The default values of the prefix and suffix are empty and '.ftlh', respectively. You can override FreeMarkerViewResolver by providing a bean of the same name.

-   If you use Groovy templates (actually, if groovy-templates is on your classpath), you also have a GroovyMarkupViewResolver named 'groovyMarkupViewResolver'. It looks for resources in a loader path by surrounding the view name with a prefix and suffix (externalized to spring.groovy.template.prefix and spring.groovy.template.suffix). The prefix and suffix have default values of 'classpath:/templates/' and '.tpl', respectively. You can override GroovyMarkupViewResolver by providing a bean of the same name.

-   If you use Mustache, you also have a MustacheViewResolver named 'mustacheViewResolver'. It looks for resources by surrounding the view name with a prefix and suffix. The prefix is spring.mustache.prefix, and the suffix is spring.mustache.suffix. The values of the prefix and suffix default to 'classpath:/templates/' and '.mustache', respectively. You can override MustacheViewResolver by providing a bean of the same name.

3.  ## Jersey

    1.  ### Secure Jersey endpoints with Spring Security

> Spring Security can be used to secure a Jersey-based web application in much the same way as it can be used to secure a Spring MVC-based web application. However, if you want to use Spring Security's method-level security with Jersey, you must configure Jersey to use setStatus(int) rather sendError(int). This prevents Jersey from committing the response before Spring Security has had an opportunity to report an authentication or authorization failure to the client.
>
> The jersey.config.server.response.setStatusOverSendError property must be set to true on the application's ResourceConfig bean, as shown in the following example:

### Use Jersey Alongside Another Web Framework

> To use Jersey alongside another web framework, such as Spring MVC, it should be configured so that it will allow the other framework to handle requests that it cannot handle. First, configure Jersey to use a Filter rather than a Servlet by configuring the spring.jersey.type application property with a value of filter. Second, configure your ResourceConfig to forward requests that would have resulted in a 404, as shown in the following example.

## HTTP Clients

> Spring Boot offers a number of starters that work with HTTP clients. This section answers questions related to using them.

### Configure RestTemplate to Use a Proxy

> As described in [RestTemplate Customization](\l), you can use a RestTemplateCustomizer with RestTemplateBuilder to build a customized RestTemplate. This is the recommended approach for creating a RestTemplate configured to use a proxy.
>
> The exact details of the proxy configuration depend on the underlying client request factory that is being used.

### Configure the TcpClient used by a Reactor Netty-based WebClient

> When Reactor Netty is on the classpath a Reactor Netty-based WebClient is auto-configured. To customize the client's handling of network connections, provide a ClientHttpConnector bean. The following example configures a 60 second connect timeout and adds a ReadTimeoutHandler:

#### import io.netty.channel.ChannelOption;

> import io.netty.handler.timeout.ReadTimeoutHandler; import reactor.netty.http.client.HttpClient;
>
> import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
>
> import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
>
> import org.springframework.http.client.reactive.ClientHttpConnector;
>
> import org.springframework.http.client.reactive.ReactorClientHttpConnector; import org.springframework.http.client.reactive.ReactorResourceFactory;
>
> \@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
>
> public class MyReactorNettyClientConfiguration {
>
> \@Bean
>
> ClientHttpConnector clientHttpConnector(ReactorResourceFactory resourceFactory) { HttpClient httpClient =

HttpClient.create(resourceFactory.getConnectionProvider())

.runOn(resourceFactory.getLoopResources())

> .option(ChannelOption.CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MILLIS, 60000)
>
> .doOnConnected((connection) -\> connection.addHandlerLast(new ReadTimeoutHandler(60)));
>
> return new ReactorClientHttpConnector(httpClient);
>
> }
>
> }

##### TIP

> Note the use of ReactorResourceFactory for the connection provider and event loop resources. This ensures efficient sharing of resources for the server receiving requests and the client making requests.

## Logging

> Spring Boot has no mandatory logging dependency, except for the Commons Logging API, which is typically provided by Spring Framework's spring-jcl module. To use Logback, you need to include it and spring-jcl on the classpath. The recommended way to do that is through the starters, which all depend on spring-boot-starter-logging. For a web application, you need only spring-boot- starter-web, since it depends transitively on the logging starter. If you use Maven, the following dependency adds logging for you:
>
> Spring Boot has a LoggingSystem abstraction that attempts to configure logging based on the content of the classpath. If Logback is available, it is the first choice.
>
> If the only change you need to make to logging is to set the levels of various loggers, you can do so in application.properties by using the \"logging.level\" prefix, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> You can also set the location of a file to which to write the log (in addition to the console) by using
>
> logging.file.name.
>
> To configure the more fine-grained settings of a logging system, you need to use the native configuration format supported by the LoggingSystem in question. By default, Spring Boot picks up the native configuration from its default location for the system (such as classpath:logback.xml for Logback), but you can set the location of the config file by using the logging.config property.

### Configure Logback for Logging

> If you need to apply customizations to logback beyond those that can be achieved with application.properties, you'll need to add a standard logback configuration file. You can add a logback.xml file to the root of your classpath for logback to find. You can also use logback-spring.xml if you want to use the [Spring Boot Logback extensions](\l).
>
> **TIP** The Logback documentation has a dedicated section that covers configuration in some detail.
>
> Spring Boot provides a number of logback configurations that be included from your own configuration. These includes are designed to allow certain common Spring Boot conventions to be re-applied.
>
> The following files are provided under org/springframework/boot/logging/logback/:

-   defaults.xml - Provides conversion rules, pattern properties and common logger configurations.

-   console-appender.xml - Adds a ConsoleAppender using the CONSOLE_LOG_PATTERN.

-   file-appender.xml - Adds a RollingFileAppender using the FILE_LOG_PATTERN and

> ROLLING_FILE_NAME_PATTERN with appropriate settings.
>
> In addition, a legacy base.xml file is provided for compatibility with earlier versions of Spring Boot. A typical custom logback.xml file would look something like this:
>
> Your logback configuration file can also make use of System properties that the LoggingSystem takes care of creating for you:

-   \${PID}: The current process ID.

-   \${LOG_FILE}: Whether logging.file.name was set in Boot's external configuration.

-   \${LOG_PATH}: Whether logging.file.path (representing a directory for log files to live in) was set in Boot's external configuration.

-   \${LOG_EXCEPTION_CONVERSION_WORD}: Whether logging.exception-conversion-word was set in Boot's external configuration.

-   \${ROLLING_FILE_NAME_PATTERN}: Whether logging.pattern.rolling-file-name was set in Boot's external configuration.

> Spring Boot also provides some nice ANSI color terminal output on a console (but not in a log file) by using a custom Logback converter. See the CONSOLE_LOG_PATTERN in the defaults.xml configuration for an example.
>
> If Groovy is on the classpath, you should be able to configure Logback with logback.groovy as well. If present, this setting is given preference.
>
> **NOTE** Spring extensions are not supported with Groovy configuration. Any logback- spring.groovy files will not be detected.

##### Configure Logback for File-only Output

> If you want to disable console logging and write output only to a file, you need a custom logback- spring.xml that imports file-appender.xml but not console-appender.xml, as shown in the following example:
>
> You also need to add logging.file.name to your application.properties or application.yaml, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

### Configure Log4j for Logging

> Spring Boot supports Log4j 2 for logging configuration if it is on the classpath. If you use the starters for assembling dependencies, you have to exclude Logback and then include log4j 2 instead. If you do not use the starters, you need to provide (at least) spring-jcl in addition to Log4j 2.
>
> The recommended path is through the starters, even though it requires some jiggling. The following example shows how to set up the starters in Maven:
>
> Gradle provides a few different ways to set up the starters. One way is to use a module replacement. To do so, declare a dependency on the Log4j 2 starter and tell Gradle that any occurrences of the default logging starter should be replaced by the Log4j 2 starter, as shown in the following example:

##### NOTE

> The Log4j starters gather together the dependencies for common logging requirements (such as having Tomcat use java.util.logging but configuring the output using Log4j 2).

##### NOTE

> To ensure that debug logging performed using java.util.logging is routed into Log4j 2, configure its JDK logging adapter by setting the java.util.logging.manager system property to org.apache.logging.log4j.jul.LogManager.

##### Use YAML or JSON to Configure Log4j 2

> In addition to its default XML configuration format, Log4j 2 also supports YAML and JSON configuration files. To configure Log4j 2 to use an alternative configuration file format, add the appropriate dependencies to the classpath and name your configuration files to match your chosen
>
> file format, as shown in the following example:

+------------+------------------------------------------------------------+------------------+
| **Format** | > **Dependencies**                                         | > **File names** |
+------------+------------------------------------------------------------+------------------+
| YAML       | > com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind +            | > log4j2.yaml +  |
|            | >                                                          | >                |
|            | > com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat:jackson-dataformat-yaml | > log4j2.yml     |
+------------+------------------------------------------------------------+------------------+
| JSON       | > com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind              | > log4j2.json +  |
|            |                                                            | >                |
|            |                                                            | > log4j2.jsn     |
+------------+------------------------------------------------------------+------------------+

## Data Access

> Spring Boot includes a number of starters for working with data sources. This section answers questions related to doing so.

### Configure a Custom DataSource

> To configure your own DataSource, define a \@Bean of that type in your configuration. Spring Boot reuses your DataSource anywhere one is required, including database initialization. If you need to externalize some settings, you can bind your DataSource to the environment (see "[Third-party](\l) [Configuration](\l)").
>
> The following example shows how to define a data source in a bean:
>
> The following example shows how to define a data source by setting properties:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> Assuming that SomeDataSource has regular JavaBean properties for the URL, the username, and the pool size, these settings are bound automatically before the DataSource is made available to other components.
>
> Spring Boot also provides a utility builder class, called DataSourceBuilder, that can be used to create one of the standard data sources (if it is on the classpath). The builder can detect the one to use based on what's available on the classpath. It also auto-detects the driver based on the JDBC URL.
>
> The following example shows how to create a data source by using a DataSourceBuilder:
>
> To run an app with that DataSource, all you need is the connection information. Pool-specific settings can also be provided. Check the implementation that is going to be used at runtime for more details.
>
> The following example shows how to define a JDBC data source by setting properties:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> However, there is a catch. Because the actual type of the connection pool is not exposed, no keys are generated in the metadata for your custom DataSource and no completion is available in your IDE (because the DataSource interface exposes no properties). Also, if you happen to have Hikari on the classpath, this basic setup does not work, because Hikari has no url property (but does have a jdbcUrl property). In that case, you must rewrite your configuration as follows:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> You can fix that by forcing the connection pool to use and return a dedicated implementation rather than DataSource. You cannot change the implementation at runtime, but the list of options will be explicit.
>
> The following example shows how create a HikariDataSource with DataSourceBuilder:
>
> You can even go further by leveraging what DataSourceProperties does for you --- that is, by providing a default embedded database with a sensible username and password if no URL is provided. You can easily initialize a DataSourceBuilder from the state of any DataSourceProperties object, so you could also inject the DataSource that Spring Boot creates automatically. However, that would split your configuration into two namespaces: url, username, password, type, and driver on spring.datasource and the rest on your custom namespace (app.datasource). To avoid that, you can redefine a custom DataSourceProperties on your custom namespace, as shown in the following example:

#### import com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource;

> import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.jdbc.DataSourceProperties; import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
>
> import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Primary;
>
> \@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false) public class MyDataSourceConfiguration {
>
> \@Bean \@Primary
>
> \@ConfigurationProperties(\"app.datasource\")
>
> public DataSourceProperties dataSourceProperties() { return new DataSourceProperties();
>
> }
>
> \@Bean \@ConfigurationProperties(\"app.datasource.configuration\")
>
> public HikariDataSource dataSource(DataSourceProperties properties) { return
>
> properties.initializeDataSourceBuilder().type(HikariDataSource.class).build();
>
> }
>
> }
>
> This setup puts you *in sync* with what Spring Boot does for you by default, except that a dedicated connection pool is chosen (in code) and its settings are exposed in the app.datasource.configuration sub namespace. Because DataSourceProperties is taking care of the url/jdbcUrl translation for you, you can configure it as follows:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*

##### TIP

> Spring Boot will expose Hikari-specific settings to spring.datasource.hikari. This example uses a more generic configuration sub namespace as the example does not support multiple datasource implementations.

##### NOTE

> Because your custom configuration chooses to go with Hikari, app.datasource.type has no effect. In practice, the builder is initialized with whatever value you might set there and then overridden by the call to .type().
>
> See "[Configure a DataSource](\l)" in the "Spring Boot features" section and the
>
> DataSourceAutoConfiguration class for more details.

### Configure Two DataSources

> If you need to configure multiple data sources, you can apply the same tricks that are described in the previous section. You must, however, mark one of the DataSource instances as \@Primary, because various auto-configurations down the road expect to be able to get one by type.
>
> If you create your own DataSource, the auto-configuration backs off. In the following example, we provide the *exact* same feature set as the auto-configuration provides on the primary data source:

#### import com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource; import org.apache.commons.dbcp2.BasicDataSource;

> import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.jdbc.DataSourceProperties; import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties; import org.springframework.boot.jdbc.DataSourceBuilder;
>
> import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
>
> import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Primary;
>
> \@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false) public class MyDataSourcesConfiguration {
>
> \@Bean \@Primary
>
> \@ConfigurationProperties(\"app.datasource.first\")
>
> public DataSourceProperties firstDataSourceProperties() { return new DataSourceProperties();
>
> }
>
> \@Bean \@Primary
>
> \@ConfigurationProperties(\"app.datasource.first.configuration\") public HikariDataSource firstDataSource(DataSourceProperties
>
> firstDataSourceProperties) { return
>
> firstDataSourceProperties.initializeDataSourceBuilder().type(HikariDataSource.class).b uild();
>
> }
>
> \@Bean \@ConfigurationProperties(\"app.datasource.second\") public BasicDataSource secondDataSource() {
>
> return DataSourceBuilder.create().type(BasicDataSource.class).build();
>
> }
>
> }

##### TIP

> firstDataSourceProperties has to be flagged as \@Primary so that the database initializer feature uses your copy (if you use the initializer).
>
> Both data sources are also bound for advanced customizations. For instance, you could configure them as follows:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> You can apply the same concept to the secondary DataSource as well, as shown in the following example:

#### import com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource; import org.apache.commons.dbcp2.BasicDataSource;

> import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.jdbc.DataSourceProperties; import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
>
> import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Primary;
>
> \@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
>
> public class MyCompleteDataSourcesConfiguration {
>
> \@Bean \@Primary
>
> \@ConfigurationProperties(\"app.datasource.first\")
>
> public DataSourceProperties firstDataSourceProperties() { return new DataSourceProperties();
>
> }
>
> \@Bean \@Primary
>
> \@ConfigurationProperties(\"app.datasource.first.configuration\") public HikariDataSource firstDataSource(DataSourceProperties
>
> firstDataSourceProperties) { return
>
> firstDataSourceProperties.initializeDataSourceBuilder().type(HikariDataSource.class).b uild();
>
> }
>
> \@Bean \@ConfigurationProperties(\"app.datasource.second\")
>
> public DataSourceProperties secondDataSourceProperties() { return new DataSourceProperties();
>
> }
>
> \@Bean \@ConfigurationProperties(\"app.datasource.second.configuration\") public BasicDataSource secondDataSource(DataSourceProperties
>
> secondDataSourceProperties) { return
>
> secondDataSourceProperties.initializeDataSourceBuilder().type(BasicDataSource.class).b uild();
>
> }
>
> }
>
> The preceding example configures two data sources on custom namespaces with the same logic as Spring Boot would use in auto-configuration. Note that each configuration sub namespace provides advanced settings based on the chosen implementation.

### Use Spring Data Repositories

> Spring Data can create implementations of \@Repository interfaces of various flavors. Spring Boot handles all of that for you, as long as those \@Repositories are included in the same package (or a sub-package) of your \@EnableAutoConfiguration class.
>
> For many applications, all you need is to put the right Spring Data dependencies on your classpath. There is a spring-boot-starter-data-jpa for JPA, spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb for Mongodb, etc. To get started, create some repository interfaces to handle your \@Entity objects.
>
> Spring Boot tries to guess the location of your \@Repository definitions, based on the \@EnableAutoConfiguration it finds. To get more control, use the \@EnableJpaRepositories annotation (from Spring Data JPA).
>
> For more about Spring Data, see the Spring Data project page.

### Separate \@Entity Definitions from Spring Configuration

> Spring Boot tries to guess the location of your \@Entity definitions, based on the \@EnableAutoConfiguration it finds. To get more control, you can use the \@EntityScan annotation, as shown in the following example:

### Configure JPA Properties

> Spring Data JPA already provides some vendor-independent configuration options (such as those for SQL logging), and Spring Boot exposes those options and a few more for Hibernate as external configuration properties. Some of them are automatically detected according to the context so you should not have to set them.
>
> The spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto is a special case, because, depending on runtime conditions, it has different defaults. If an embedded database is used and no schema manager (such as Liquibase or Flyway) is handling the DataSource, it defaults to create-drop. In all other cases, it defaults to none.
>
> The dialect to use is detected by the JPA provider. If you prefer to set the dialect yourself, set the
>
> spring.jpa.database-platform property.
>
> The most common options to set are shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> In addition, all properties in spring.jpa.properties.\* are passed through as normal JPA properties (with the prefix stripped) when the local EntityManagerFactory is created.

##### WARNING

> You need to ensure that names defined under spring.jpa.properties.\* exactly match those expected by your JPA provider. Spring Boot will not attempt any kind of relaxed binding for these entries.
>
> For example, if you want to configure Hibernate's batch size you must use spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.jdbc.batch_size. If you use other forms, such as batchSize or batch-size, Hibernate will not apply the setting.

##### TIP

> If you need to apply advanced customization to Hibernate properties, consider registering a HibernatePropertiesCustomizer bean that will be invoked prior to creating the EntityManagerFactory. This takes precedence to anything that is applied by the auto-configuration.

### Configure Hibernate Naming Strategy

> Hibernate uses two different naming strategies to map names from the object model to the corresponding database names. The fully qualified class name of the physical and the implicit strategy implementations can be configured by setting the spring.jpa.hibernate.naming.physical- strategy and spring.jpa.hibernate.naming.implicit-strategy properties, respectively. Alternatively, if ImplicitNamingStrategy or PhysicalNamingStrategy beans are available in the application context, Hibernate will be automatically configured to use them.
>
> By default, Spring Boot configures the physical naming strategy with SpringPhysicalNamingStrategy. This implementation provides the same table structure as Hibernate 4: all dots are replaced by underscores and camel casing is replaced by underscores as well. Additionally, by default, all table names are generated in lower case. For example, a TelephoneNumber entity is mapped to the telephone_number table. If your schema requires mixed-case identifiers, define a custom SpringPhysicalNamingStrategy bean, as shown in the following example:
>
> If you prefer to use Hibernate 5's default instead, set the following property:
>
> Alternatively, you can configure the following bean:
>
> See HibernateJpaAutoConfiguration and JpaBaseConfiguration for more details.

### Configure Hibernate Second-Level Caching

> Hibernate second-level cache can be configured for a range of cache providers. Rather than configuring Hibernate to lookup the cache provider again, it is better to provide the one that is available in the context whenever possible.
>
> To do this with JCache, first make sure that org.hibernate:hibernate-jcache is available on the classpath. Then, add a HibernatePropertiesCustomizer bean as shown in the following example:
>
> This customizer will configure Hibernate to use the same CacheManager as the one that the application uses. It is also possible to use separate CacheManager instances. For details, refer to the Hibernate user guide.

### Use Dependency Injection in Hibernate Components

> By default, Spring Boot registers a BeanContainer implementation that uses the BeanFactory so that converters and entity listeners can use regular dependency injection.
>
> You can disable or tune this behavior by registering a HibernatePropertiesCustomizer that removes or changes the hibernate.resource.beans.container property.

### Use a Custom EntityManagerFactory

> To take full control of the configuration of the EntityManagerFactory, you need to add a \@Bean named 'entityManagerFactory'. Spring Boot auto-configuration switches off its entity manager in the presence of a bean of that type.

### Using Multiple EntityManagerFactories

> If you need to use JPA against multiple data sources, you likely need one EntityManagerFactory per
>
> data source. The LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean from Spring ORM allows you to configure an EntityManagerFactory for your needs. You can also reuse JpaProperties to bind settings for each EntityManagerFactory, as shown in the following example:

#### import javax.sql.DataSource;

> import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.orm.jpa.JpaProperties;
>
> import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties; import org.springframework.boot.orm.jpa.EntityManagerFactoryBuilder;
>
> import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
>
> import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration; import org.springframework.orm.jpa.JpaVendorAdapter;
>
> import org.springframework.orm.jpa.LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean; import org.springframework.orm.jpa.vendor.HibernateJpaVendorAdapter;
>
> \@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
>
> public class MyEntityManagerFactoryConfiguration {
>
> \@Bean \@ConfigurationProperties(\"app.jpa.first\") public JpaProperties firstJpaProperties() {
>
> return new JpaProperties();
>
> }
>
> \@Bean
>
> public LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean firstEntityManagerFactory(DataSource firstDataSource,
>
> JpaProperties firstJpaProperties) { EntityManagerFactoryBuilder builder =
>
> createEntityManagerFactoryBuilder(firstJpaProperties); return
>
> builder.dataSource(firstDataSource).packages(Order.class).persistenceUnit(\"firstDs\").b uild();
>
> }
>

##### NOTE

> When you create a bean for LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean yourself, any customization that was applied during the creation of the auto-configured LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean is lost. For example, in case of Hibernate, any properties under the spring.jpa.hibernate prefix will not be automatically applied to your LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean. If you were relying on these properties for configuring things like the naming strategy or the DDL mode, you will need to explicitly configure that when creating the LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean bean.
>
> You should provide a similar configuration for any additional data sources for which you need JPA access. To complete the picture, you need to configure a JpaTransactionManager for each EntityManagerFactory as well. Alternatively, you might be able to use a JTA transaction manager that spans both.
>
> If you use Spring Data, you need to configure \@EnableJpaRepositories accordingly, as shown in the following examples:

### Use a Traditional persistence.xml File

> Spring Boot will not search for or use a META-INF/persistence.xml by default. If you prefer to use a traditional persistence.xml, you need to define your own \@Bean of type LocalEntityManagerFactoryBean (with an ID of 'entityManagerFactory') and set the persistence unit name there.
>
> See JpaBaseConfiguration for the default settings.

### Use Spring Data JPA and Mongo Repositories

> Spring Data JPA and Spring Data Mongo can both automatically create Repository implementations for you. If they are both present on the classpath, you might have to do some extra configuration to tell Spring Boot which repositories to create. The most explicit way to do that is to use the standard Spring Data \@EnableJpaRepositories and \@EnableMongoRepositories annotations and provide the location of your Repository interfaces.
>
> There are also flags (spring.data.\*.repositories.enabled and spring.data.\*.repositories.type) that you can use to switch the auto-configured repositories on and off in external configuration. Doing so is useful, for instance, in case you want to switch off the Mongo repositories and still use the auto-configured MongoTemplate.
>
> The same obstacle and the same features exist for other auto-configured Spring Data repository types (Elasticsearch, Solr, and others). To work with them, change the names of the annotations and flags accordingly.

### Customize Spring Data's Web Support

> Spring Data provides web support that simplifies the use of Spring Data repositories in a web application. Spring Boot provides properties in the spring.data.web namespace for customizing its configuration. Note that if you are using Spring Data REST, you must use the properties in the spring.data.rest namespace instead.

### Expose Spring Data Repositories as REST Endpoint

> Spring Data REST can expose the Repository implementations as REST endpoints for you, provided Spring MVC has been enabled for the application.
>
> Spring Boot exposes a set of useful properties (from the spring.data.rest namespace) that customize the RepositoryRestConfiguration. If you need to provide additional customization, you should use a RepositoryRestConfigurer bean.

##### NOTE

> If you do not specify any order on your custom RepositoryRestConfigurer, it runs after the one Spring Boot uses internally. If you need to specify an order, make sure it is higher than 0.

### Configure a Component that is Used by JPA

> If you want to configure a component that JPA uses, then you need to ensure that the component is initialized before JPA. When the component is auto-configured, Spring Boot takes care of this for you. For example, when Flyway is auto-configured, Hibernate is configured to depend upon Flyway so that Flyway has a chance to initialize the database before Hibernate tries to use it.
>
> If you are configuring a component yourself, you can use an EntityManagerFactoryDependsOnPostProcessor subclass as a convenient way of setting up the necessary dependencies. For example, if you use Hibernate Search with Elasticsearch as its index
>
> manager, any EntityManagerFactory beans must be configured to depend on the elasticsearchClient
>
> bean, as shown in the following example:

### Configure jOOQ with Two DataSources

> If you need to use jOOQ with multiple data sources, you should create your own DSLContext for each one. Refer to JooqAutoConfiguration for more details.
>
> **TIP** In particular, JooqExceptionTranslator and SpringTransactionProvider can be reused to provide similar features to what the auto-configuration does with a single DataSource.

## Database Initialization

> An SQL database can be initialized in different ways depending on what your stack is. Of course, you can also do it manually, provided the database is a separate process. It is recommended to use a single mechanism for schema generation.

### Initialize a Database Using JPA

> JPA has features for DDL generation, and these can be set up to run on startup against the database. This is controlled through two external properties:

-   spring.jpa.generate-ddl (boolean) switches the feature on and off and is vendor independent.

-   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto (enum) is a Hibernate feature that controls the behavior in a more fine-grained way. This feature is described in more detail later in this guide.

### Initialize a Database Using Hibernate

> You can set spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto explicitly and the standard Hibernate property values are none, validate, update, create, and create-drop. Spring Boot chooses a default value for you based on whether it thinks your database is embedded. It defaults to create-drop if no schema manager has been detected or none in all other cases. An embedded database is detected by looking at the Connection type and JDBC url. hsqldb, h2, and derby are candidates, and others are not. Be careful when switching from in-memory to a 'real' database that you do not make assumptions about the existence of the tables and data in the new platform. You either have to set ddl-auto explicitly or use one of the other mechanisms to initialize the database.
>
> **NOTE** You can output the schema creation by enabling the org.hibernate.SQL logger. This is done for you automatically if you enable the [debug mode](\l).
>
> In addition, a file named import.sql in the root of the classpath is executed on startup if Hibernate creates the schema from scratch (that is, if the ddl-auto property is set to create or create-drop). This can be useful for demos and for testing if you are careful but is probably not something you want to be on the classpath in production. It is a Hibernate feature (and has nothing to do with Spring).

### Initialize a Database Using Basic SQL Scripts

> Spring Boot can automatically create the schema (DDL scripts) of your JDBC DataSource or R2DBC ConnectionFactory and initialize it (DML scripts). It loads SQL from the standard root classpath locations: schema.sql and data.sql, respectively. In addition, Spring Boot processes the schema-
>
> \${platform}.sql and data-\${platform}.sql files (if present), where platform is the value of spring.sql.init.platform. This allows you to switch to database-specific scripts if necessary. For example, you might choose to set it to the vendor name of the database (hsqldb, h2, oracle, mysql, postgresql, and so on). By default, SQL database initialization is only performed when using an embedded in-memory database. To always initialize an SQL database, irrespective of its type, set spring.sql.init.mode to always. Similarly, to disable initialization, set spring.sql.init.mode to never. By default, Spring Boot enables the fail-fast feature of its script-based database initializer. This
>
> means that, if the scripts cause exceptions, the application fails to start. You can tune that behavior by setting spring.sql.init.continue-on-error.
>
> Script-based DataSource initialization is performed, by default, before any JPA EntityManagerFactory beans are created. schema.sql can be used to create the schema for JPA-managed entities and data.sql can be used to populate it. While we do not recommend using multiple data source initialization technologies, if you want script-based DataSource initialization to be able to build upon the schema creation performed by Hibernate, set spring.jpa.defer-datasource-initialization to true. This will defer data source initialization until after any EntityManagerFactory beans have been created and initialized. schema.sql can then be used to make additions to any schema creation performed by Hibernate and data.sql can be used to populate it.
>
> If you are using a [Higher-level Database Migration Tool](\l), like Flyway or Liquibase, you should use them alone to create and initialize the schema. Using the basic schema.sql and data.sql scripts alongside Flyway or Liquibase is not recommended and support will be removed in a future release.

### Initialize a Spring Batch Database

> If you use Spring Batch, it comes pre-packaged with SQL initialization scripts for most popular database platforms. Spring Boot can detect your database type and execute those scripts on startup. If you use an embedded database, this happens by default. You can also enable it for any database type, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> You can also switch off the initialization explicitly by setting spring.batch.jdbc.initialize-schema to
>
> never.

### Use a Higher-level Database Migration Tool

> Spring Boot supports two higher-level migration tools: Flyway and Liquibase.

##### Execute Flyway Database Migrations on Startup

> To automatically run Flyway database migrations on startup, add the org.flywaydb:flyway-core to your classpath.
>
> Typically, migrations are scripts in the form V\<VERSION> \<NAME>.sql (with \<VERSION> an underscore- separated version, such as '1' or '2_1'). By default, they are in a directory called classpath:db/migration, but you can modify that location by setting spring.flyway.locations. This is a comma-separated list of one or more classpath: or filesystem: locations. For example, the following configuration would search for scripts in both the default classpath location and the
>
> /opt/migration directory:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> You can also add a special {vendor} placeholder to use vendor-specific scripts. Assume the
>
> following:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> Rather than using db/migration, the preceding configuration sets the directory to use according to the type of the database (such as db/migration/mysql for MySQL). The list of supported databases is available in DatabaseDriver.
>
> Migrations can also be written in Java. Flyway will be auto-configured with any beans that implement JavaMigration.
>
> FlywayProperties provides most of Flyway's settings and a small set of additional properties that can be used to disable the migrations or switch off the location checking. If you need more control over the configuration, consider registering a FlywayConfigurationCustomizer bean.
>
> Spring Boot calls Flyway.migrate() to perform the database migration. If you would like more control, provide a \@Bean that implements FlywayMigrationStrategy.
>
> Flyway supports SQL and Java callbacks. To use SQL-based callbacks, place the callback scripts in the classpath:db/migration directory. To use Java-based callbacks, create one or more beans that implement Callback. Any such beans are automatically registered with Flyway. They can be ordered by using \@Order or by implementing Ordered. Beans that implement the deprecated FlywayCallback interface can also be detected, however they cannot be used alongside Callback beans.
>
> By default, Flyway autowires the (\@Primary) DataSource in your context and uses that for migrations. If you like to use a different DataSource, you can create one and mark its \@Bean as \@FlywayDataSource. If you do so and want two data sources, remember to create another one and mark it as \@Primary. Alternatively, you can use Flyway's native DataSource by setting spring.flyway.\[url,user,password\] in external properties. Setting either spring.flyway.url or spring.flyway.user is sufficient to cause Flyway to use its own DataSource. If any of the three properties has not been set, the value of its equivalent spring.datasource property will be used.
>
> You can also use Flyway to provide data for specific scenarios. For example, you can place test- specific migrations in src/test/resources and they are run only when your application starts for testing. Also, you can use profile-specific configuration to customize spring.flyway.locations so that certain migrations run only when a particular profile is active. For example, in application- dev.properties, you might specify the following setting:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> With that setup, migrations in dev/db/migration run only when the dev profile is active.

##### Execute Liquibase Database Migrations on Startup

> To automatically run Liquibase database migrations on startup, add the org.liquibase:liquibase- core to your classpath.

##### NOTE

> When you add the org.liquibase:liquibase-core to your classpath, database migrations run by default for both during application startup and before your tests run. This behavior can be customized by using the spring.liquibase.enabled property, setting different values in the main and test configurations. It is not possible to use two different ways to initialize the database (e.g. Liquibase for application startup, JPA for test runs).
>
> By default, the master change log is read from db/changelog/db.changelog-master.yaml, but you can change the location by setting spring.liquibase.change-log. In addition to YAML, Liquibase also supports JSON, XML, and SQL change log formats.
>
> By default, Liquibase autowires the (\@Primary) DataSource in your context and uses that for migrations. If you need to use a different DataSource, you can create one and mark its \@Bean as \@LiquibaseDataSource. If you do so and you want two data sources, remember to create another one and mark it as \@Primary. Alternatively, you can use Liquibase's native DataSource by setting spring.liquibase.\[driver-class-name,url,user,password\] in external properties. Setting either spring.liquibase.url or spring.liquibase.user is sufficient to cause Liquibase to use its own DataSource. If any of the three properties has not been set, the value of its equivalent spring.datasource property will be used.
>
> See LiquibaseProperties for details about available settings such as contexts, the default schema, and others.

### Depend Upon an Initialized Database

> Database initialization is performed while the application is starting up as part of application context refresh. To allow an initialized database to be accessed during startup, beans that act as database initializers and beans that require that database to have been initialized are detected automatically. Beans whose initialization depends upon the database having been initialized are configured to depend upon those that initialize it. If, during startup, your application tries to access the database and it has not been initialized, you can configure additional detection of beans that
>
> initialize the database and require the database to have been initialized.

##### Detect a Database Initializer

> Spring Boot will automatically detect beans of the following types that initialize an SQL database:

-   DataSourceScriptDatabaseInitializer

-   EntityManagerFactory

-   Flyway

-   FlywayMigrationInitializer

-   R2dbcScriptDatabaseInitializer

-   SpringLiquibase

> If you are using a third-party starter for a database initialization library, it may provide a detector such that beans of other types are also detected automatically. To have other beans be detected, register an implementation of DatabaseInitializerDetector in META-INF/spring-factories.

##### Detect a Bean That Depends On Database Initialization

> Spring Boot will automatically detect beans of the following types that depends upon database initialization:

-   AbstractEntityManagerFactoryBean (unless spring.jpa.defer-datasource-initialization is set to

> true)

-   DSLContext (jOOQ)

-   EntityManagerFactory (unless spring.jpa.defer-datasource-initialization is set to true)

-   JdbcOperations

-   NamedParameterJdbcOperations

> If you are using a third-party starter data access library, it may provide a detector such that beans of other types are also detected automatically. To have other beans be detected, register an implementation of DependsOnDatabaseInitializationDetector in META-INF/spring-factories. Alternatively, annotate the bean's class or its \@Bean method with \@DependsOnDatabaseInitialization.

## Messaging

> Spring Boot offers a number of starters to support messaging. This section answers questions that arise from using messaging with Spring Boot.

### Disable Transacted JMS Session

> If your JMS broker does not support transacted sessions, you have to disable the support of transactions altogether. If you create your own JmsListenerContainerFactory, there is nothing to do, since, by default it cannot be transacted. If you want to use the DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactoryConfigurer to reuse Spring Boot's default, you can disable transacted sessions, as follows:

#### import javax.jms.ConnectionFactory;

> import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.jms.DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactoryConfigure r;
>
> import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
>
> import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
>
> import org.springframework.jms.config.DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactory;
>
> \@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false) public class MyJmsConfiguration {
>
> \@Bean
>
> public DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactory jmsListenerContainerFactory(ConnectionFactory connectionFactory,
>
> DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactoryConfigurer configurer) { DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactory listenerFactory = new
>
> DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactory(); configurer.configure(listenerFactory, connectionFactory); listenerFactory.setTransactionManager(null); listenerFactory.setSessionTransacted(false);
>
> return listenerFactory;
>
> }
>
> }
>
> The preceding example overrides the default factory, and it should be applied to any other factory that your application defines, if any.

## Batch Applications

> A number of questions often arise when people use Spring Batch from within a Spring Boot application. This section addresses those questions.

### Specifying a Batch Data Source

> By default, batch applications require a DataSource to store job details. Spring Batch expects a single DataSource by default. To have it use a DataSource other than the application's main DataSource, declare a DataSource bean, annotating its \@Bean method with \@BatchDataSource. If you do so and want two data sources, remember to mark the other one \@Primary. To take greater control, implement BatchConfigurer. See The Javadoc of \@EnableBatchProcessing for more details.
>
> For more info about Spring Batch, see the Spring Batch project page.

### Running Spring Batch Jobs on Startup

> Spring Batch auto-configuration is enabled by adding \@EnableBatchProcessing to one of your
>
> \@Configuration classes.
>
> By default, it executes **all** Jobs in the application context on startup (see JobLauncherApplicationRunner for details). You can narrow down to a specific job or jobs by specifying spring.batch.job.names (which takes a comma-separated list of job name patterns).
>
> See BatchAutoConfiguration and \@EnableBatchProcessing for more details.

### Running from the Command Line

> Spring Boot converts any command line argument starting with \-- to a property to add to the Environment, see [accessing command line properties](\l). This should not be used to pass arguments to batch jobs. To specify batch arguments on the command line, use the regular format (i.e. without \--
>
> ), as shown in the following example:
>
> If you specify a property of the Environment on the command line, it is ignored by the job. Consider the following command:
>
> This provides only one argument to the batch job: someParameter=someValue.

### Storing the Job Repository

> Spring Batch requires a data store for the Job repository. If you use Spring Boot, you must use an actual database. Note that it can be an in-memory database, see Configuring a Job Repository.

## Actuator

> Spring Boot includes the Spring Boot Actuator. This section answers questions that often arise from its use.

### Change the HTTP Port or Address of the Actuator Endpoints

> In a standalone application, the Actuator HTTP port defaults to the same as the main HTTP port. To make the application listen on a different port, set the external property: management.server.port. To listen on a completely different network address (such as when you have an internal network for management and an external one for user applications), you can also set management.server.address to a valid IP address to which the server is able to bind.
>
> For more detail, see the ManagementServerProperties source code and "[Customizing the Management](\l) [Server Port](\l)" in the "Production-ready features" section.

### Customize the 'whitelabel' Error Page

> Spring Boot installs a 'whitelabel' error page that you see in a browser client if you encounter a server error (machine clients consuming JSON and other media types should see a sensible
>
> response with the right error code).

##### NOTE

> Set server.error.whitelabel.enabled=false to switch the default error page off. Doing so restores the default of the servlet container that you are using. Note that Spring Boot still tries to resolve the error view, so you should probably add your own error page rather than disabling it completely.
>
> Overriding the error page with your own depends on the templating technology that you use. For example, if you use Thymeleaf, you can add an error.html template. If you use FreeMarker, you can add an error.ftlh template. In general, you need a View that resolves with a name of error or a \@Controller that handles the /error path. Unless you replaced some of the default configuration, you should find a BeanNameViewResolver in your ApplicationContext, so a \@Bean named error would be one way of doing that. See ErrorMvcAutoConfiguration for more options.
>
> See also the section on "[Error Handling](\l)" for details of how to register handlers in the servlet container.

### Sanitize Sensitive Values

> Information returned by the env and configprops endpoints can be somewhat sensitive so keys matching certain patterns are sanitized by default (i.e. their values are replaced by \*\*\*\*\*\*). Spring Boot uses sensible defaults for such keys: any key ending with the word \"password\", \"secret\", \"key\", \"token\", \"vcap_services\", \"sun.java.command\" is entirely sanitized. Additionally, any key that holds the word credentials (configured as a regular expression, i.e. \*credentials.\*) as part of the key is also entirely sanitized.
>
> Furthermore, Spring Boot sanitizes the sensitive portion of URI-like values for keys with one of the following endings:

-   address

-   addresses

-   uri

-   uris

-   url

-   urls

> The sensitive portion of the URI is identified using the format

+---------------------------------------------------------+-------+-------------+-------------+----------+
| > \<scheme>://\<username>:\<password>@\<host>:\<port>/. | > For | > example,  | > for the   | property |
| >                                                       | >     | >           | >           |          |
| > myclient.uri=http://user1:password1\@localhost:8081,  | > the | > resulting | > sanitized | value is |
+---------------------------------------------------------+-------+-------------+-------------+----------+
| > http://user1:\*\*\*\*\*\*\@localhost:8081.            |       |             |             |          |
+---------------------------------------------------------+-------+-------------+-------------+----------+

> The default patterns used by the env and configprops endpoints can be replaced using management.endpoint.env.keys-to-sanitize and management.endpoint.configprops.keys-to-sanitize respectively. Alternatively, additional patterns can be configured using management.endpoint.env.additional-keys-to-sanitize and management.endpoint.configprops.additional-keys-to-sanitize.

### Map Health Indicators to Micrometer Metrics

> Spring Boot health indicators return a Status type to indicate the overall system health. If you want to monitor or alert on levels of health for a particular application, you can export these statuses as metrics via Micrometer. By default, the status codes "UP", "DOWN", "OUT_OF_SERVICE" and "UNKNOWN" are used by Spring Boot. To export these, you'll need to convert these states to some set of numbers so that they can be used with a Micrometer Gauge.
>
> The following example shows one way to write such an exporter:

## Security

> This section addresses questions about security when working with Spring Boot, including questions that arise from using Spring Security with Spring Boot.
>
> For more about Spring Security, see the Spring Security project page.

### Switch off the Spring Boot Security Configuration

> If you define a \@Configuration with a WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter or a SecurityFilterChain bean in your application, it switches off the default webapp security settings in Spring Boot.

### Change the UserDetailsService and Add User Accounts

> If you provide a \@Bean of type AuthenticationManager, AuthenticationProvider, or UserDetailsService, the default \@Bean for InMemoryUserDetailsManager is not created. This means you have the full feature set of Spring Security available (such as various authentication options).
>
> The easiest way to add user accounts is to provide your own UserDetailsService bean.

### Enable HTTPS When Running behind a Proxy Server

> Ensuring that all your main endpoints are only available over HTTPS is an important chore for any application. If you use Tomcat as a servlet container, then Spring Boot adds Tomcat's own RemoteIpValve automatically if it detects some environment settings, and you should be able to rely on the HttpServletRequest to report whether it is secure or not (even downstream of a proxy server that handles the real SSL termination). The standard behavior is determined by the presence or absence of certain request headers (x-forwarded-for and x-forwarded-proto), whose names are conventional, so it should work with most front-end proxies. You can switch on the valve by adding some entries to application.properties, as shown in the following example:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> (The presence of either of those properties switches on the valve. Alternatively, you can add the RemoteIpValve by customizing the TomcatServletWebServerFactory using a WebServerFactoryCustomizer bean.)
>
> To configure Spring Security to require a secure channel for all (or some) requests, consider adding your own SecurityFilterChain bean that adds the following HttpSecurity configuration:

## Hot Swapping

> Spring Boot supports hot swapping. This section answers questions about how it works.

### Reload Static Content

> There are several options for hot reloading. The recommended approach is to use [spring-boot-](\l) [devtools](\l), as it provides additional development-time features, such as support for fast application restarts and LiveReload as well as sensible development-time configuration (such as template caching). Devtools works by monitoring the classpath for changes. This means that static resource changes must be \"built\" for the change to take effect. By default, this happens automatically in Eclipse when you save your changes. In IntelliJ IDEA, the Make Project command triggers the necessary build. Due to the [default restart exclusions](\l), changes to static resources do not trigger a restart of your application. They do, however, trigger a live reload.
>
> Alternatively, running in an IDE (especially with debugging on) is a good way to do development (all modern IDEs allow reloading of static resources and usually also allow hot-swapping of Java class changes).
>
> Finally, the [Maven and Gradle plugins](\l) can be configured (see the addResources property) to support running from the command line with reloading of static files directly from source. You can use that with an external css/js compiler process if you are writing that code with higher-level tools.

### Reload Templates without Restarting the Container

> Most of the templating technologies supported by Spring Boot include a configuration option to disable caching (described later in this document). If you use the spring-boot-devtools module, these properties are [automatically configured](\l) for you at development time.

##### Thymeleaf Templates

> If you use Thymeleaf, set spring.thymeleaf.cache to false. See ThymeleafAutoConfiguration for other Thymeleaf customization options.

##### FreeMarker Templates

> If you use FreeMarker, set spring.freemarker.cache to false. See FreeMarkerAutoConfiguration for other FreeMarker customization options.

##### Groovy Templates

> If you use Groovy templates, set spring.groovy.template.cache to false. See
>
> GroovyTemplateAutoConfiguration for other Groovy customization options.

### Fast Application Restarts

> The spring-boot-devtools module includes support for automatic application restarts. While not as fast as technologies such as JRebel it is usually significantly faster than a "cold start". You should probably give it a try before investigating some of the more complex reload options discussed later in this document.
>
> For more details, see the [Developer Tools](\l) section.

### Reload Java Classes without Restarting the Container

> Many modern IDEs (Eclipse, IDEA, and others) support hot swapping of bytecode. Consequently, if you make a change that does not affect class or method signatures, it should reload cleanly with no side effects.

## Testing

> Spring Boot includes a number of testing utilities and support classes as well as a dedicated starter that provides common test dependencies. This section answers common questions about testing.

### Testing With Spring Security

> Spring Security provides support for running tests as a specific user. For example, the test in the snippet below will run with an authenticated user that has the ADMIN role.
>
> Spring Security provides comprehensive integration with Spring MVC Test and this can also be used when testing controllers using the \@WebMvcTest slice and MockMvc.
>
> For additional details on Spring Security's testing support, refer to Spring Security's reference documentation).

### Use Testcontainers for Integration Testing

> The Testcontainers library provides a way to manage services running inside Docker containers. It integrates with JUnit, allowing you to write a test class that can start up a container before any of the tests run. Testcontainers is especially useful for writing integration tests that talk to a real backend service such as MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra etc. Testcontainers can be used in a Spring Boot test as follows:
>
> This will start up a docker container running Neo4j (if Docker is running locally) before any of the tests are run. In most cases, you will need to configure the application using details from the running container, such as container IP or port.
>
> This can be done with a static \@DynamicPropertySource method that allows adding dynamic property values to the Spring Environment.
>
> The above configuration allows Neo4j-related beans in the application to communicate with Neo4j running inside the Testcontainers-managed Docker container.

## Build

> Spring Boot includes build plugins for Maven and Gradle. This section answers common questions about these plugins.

### Generate Build Information

> Both the Maven plugin and the Gradle plugin allow generating build information containing the coordinates, name, and version of the project. The plugins can also be configured to add additional properties through configuration. When such a file is present, Spring Boot auto-configures a BuildProperties bean.
>
> To generate build information with Maven, add an execution for the build-info goal, as shown in the following example:
>
> **TIP** See the Spring Boot Maven Plugin documentation for more details.
>
> The following example does the same with Gradle:
>
> **TIP** See the Spring Boot Gradle Plugin documentation for more details.

### Generate Git Information

> Both Maven and Gradle allow generating a git.properties file containing information about the state of your git source code repository when the project was built.
>
> For Maven users, the spring-boot-starter-parent POM includes a pre-configured plugin to generate a git.properties file. To use it, add the following declaration for the Git Commit Id Plugin to your POM:
>
> Gradle users can achieve the same result by using the gradle-git-properties plugin, as shown in the
>
> following example:
>
> Both the Maven and Gradle plugins allow the properties that are included in git.properties to be configured.

##### TIP

> The commit time in git.properties is expected to match the following format: yyyy-MM- dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ. This is the default format for both plugins listed above. Using this format lets the time be parsed into a Date and its format, when serialized to JSON, to be controlled by Jackson's date serialization configuration settings.

### Customize Dependency Versions

> The spring-boot-dependencies POM manages the versions of common dependencies. The Spring Boot plugins for Maven and Gradle allow these managed dependency versions to be customized using build properties.
>
> **WARNING** Each Spring Boot release is designed and tested against this specific set of third-party dependencies. Overriding versions may cause compatibility issues.
>
> To override dependency versions with Maven, see this section of the Maven plugin's documentation.
>
> To override dependency versions in Gradle, see this section of the Gradle plugin's documentation.

### Create an Executable JAR with Maven

### Use a Spring Boot Application as a Dependency

> Like a war file, a Spring Boot application is not intended to be used as a dependency. If your application contains classes that you want to share with other projects, the recommended approach is to move that code into a separate module. The separate module can then be depended upon by your application and other projects.
>
> If you cannot rearrange your code as recommended above, Spring Boot's Maven and Gradle plugins must be configured to produce a separate artifact that is suitable for use as a dependency. The executable archive cannot be used as a dependency as the [executable jar format](\l) packages application classes in BOOT-INF/classes. This means that they cannot be found when the executable jar is used as a dependency.
>
> To produce the two artifacts, one that can be used as a dependency and one that is executable, a classifier must be specified. This classifier is applied to the name of the executable archive, leaving the default archive for use as a dependency.
>
> To configure a classifier of exec in Maven, you can use the following configuration:

### Extract Specific Libraries When an Executable Jar Runs

> Most nested libraries in an executable jar do not need to be unpacked in order to run. However, certain libraries can have problems. For example, JRuby includes its own nested jar support, which assumes that the jruby-complete.jar is always directly available as a file in its own right.
>
> To deal with any problematic libraries, you can flag that specific nested jars should be automatically unpacked when the executable jar first runs. Such nested jars are written beneath the temporary directory identified by the java.io.tmpdir system property.

##### WARNING

> Care should be taken to ensure that your operating system is configured so that it will not delete the jars that have been unpacked to the temporary directory while the application is still running.
>
> For example, to indicate that JRuby should be flagged for unpacking by using the Maven Plugin, you would add the following configuration:

### Create a Non-executable JAR with Exclusions

> Often, if you have an executable and a non-executable jar as two separate build products, the executable version has additional configuration files that are not needed in a library jar. For example, the application.yml configuration file might be excluded from the non-executable JAR.
>
> In Maven, the executable jar must be the main artifact and you can add a classified jar for the library, as follows:

### Remote Debug a Spring Boot Application Started with Maven

> To attach a remote debugger to a Spring Boot application that was started with Maven, you can use the jvmArguments property of the maven plugin.
>
> See this example for more details.

### Build an Executable Archive from Ant without Using spring-boot- antlib

> To build with Ant, you need to grab dependencies, compile, and then create a jar or war archive. To make it executable, you can either use the spring-boot-antlib module or you can follow these instructions:

1.  If you are building a jar, package the application's classes and resources in a nested BOOT- INF/classes directory. If you are building a war, package the application's classes in a nested WEB-INF/classes directory as usual.

2.  Add the runtime dependencies in a nested BOOT-INF/lib directory for a jar or WEB-INF/lib for a war. Remember **not** to compress the entries in the archive.

3.  Add the provided (embedded container) dependencies in a nested BOOT-INF/lib directory for a jar or WEB-INF/lib-provided for a war. Remember **not** to compress the entries in the archive.

4.  Add the spring-boot-loader classes at the root of the archive (so that the Main-Class is available).

5.  Use the appropriate launcher (such as JarLauncher for a jar file) as a Main-Class attribute in the manifest and specify the other properties it needs as manifest entries --- principally, by setting a Start-Class property.

> The following example shows how to build an executable archive with Ant:

#### \<target name=\"build\" depends=\"compile\"\>

> \<jar destfile=\"target/\${ant.project.name}-\${spring-boot.version}.jar\" compress=\"false\"\>

## Traditional Deployment

> Spring Boot supports traditional deployment as well as more modern forms of deployment. This section answers common questions about traditional deployment.

### Create a Deployable War File

##### WARNING

> Because Spring WebFlux does not strictly depend on the Servlet API and applications are deployed by default on an embedded Reactor Netty server, War deployment is not supported for WebFlux applications.
>
> The first step in producing a deployable war file is to provide a SpringBootServletInitializer subclass and override its configure method. Doing so makes use of Spring Framework's Servlet 3.0 support and lets you configure your application when it is launched by the servlet container. Typically, you should update your application's main class to extend SpringBootServletInitializer, as shown in the following example:
>
> import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
>
> import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication; import org.springframework.boot.builder.SpringApplicationBuilder;
>
> import org.springframework.boot.web.servlet.support.SpringBootServletInitializer;
>
> \@SpringBootApplication
>
> public class MyApplication extends SpringBootServletInitializer {
>
> \@Override
>
> protected SpringApplicationBuilder configure(SpringApplicationBuilder application)
>
> {
>
> return application.sources(MyApplication.class);
>
> }
>
> public static void main(String\[\] args) { SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
>
> }
>
> }
>
> The next step is to update your build configuration such that your project produces a war file rather than a jar file. If you use Maven and spring-boot-starter-parent (which configures Maven's war plugin for you), all you need to do is to modify pom.xml to change the packaging to war, as follows:
>
> If you use Gradle, you need to modify build.gradle to apply the war plugin to the project, as follows:
>
> The final step in the process is to ensure that the embedded servlet container does not interfere with the servlet container to which the war file is deployed. To do so, you need to mark the embedded servlet container dependency as being provided.
>
> If you use Maven, the following example marks the servlet container (Tomcat, in this case) as being provided:
>
> If you use Gradle, the following example marks the servlet container (Tomcat, in this case) as being provided:

##### TIP

> providedRuntime is preferred to Gradle's compileOnly configuration. Among other limitations, compileOnly dependencies are not on the test classpath, so any web-based integration tests fail.
>
> If you use the [Spring Boot build tools](\l), marking the embedded servlet container dependency as provided produces an executable war file with the provided dependencies packaged in a lib- provided directory. This means that, in addition to being deployable to a servlet container, you can also run your application by using java -jar on the command line.

### Convert an Existing Application to Spring Boot

> To convert an existing non-web Spring application to a Spring Boot application, replace the code that creates your ApplicationContext and replace it with calls to SpringApplication or SpringApplicationBuilder. Spring MVC web applications are generally amenable to first creating a deployable war application and then migrating it later to an executable war or jar. See the Getting Started Guide on Converting a jar to a war.
>
> To create a deployable war by extending SpringBootServletInitializer (for example, in a class called Application) and adding the Spring Boot \@SpringBootApplication annotation, use code similar to that shown in the following example:

#### import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;

> import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication; import org.springframework.boot.builder.SpringApplicationBuilder;
>
> import org.springframework.boot.web.servlet.support.SpringBootServletInitializer;
>
> \@SpringBootApplication
>
> public class MyApplication extends SpringBootServletInitializer {
>
> \@Override
>
> protected SpringApplicationBuilder configure(SpringApplicationBuilder application)
>
> {
>
> // Customize the application or call application.sources(\...) to add sources
>
> // Since our example is itself a \@Configuration class (via
>
> \@SpringBootApplication)
>
> // we actually don\'t need to override this method. return application;
>
> }
>
> }
>
> Remember that, whatever you put in the sources is merely a Spring ApplicationContext. Normally, anything that already works should work here. There might be some beans you can remove later and let Spring Boot provide its own defaults for them, but it should be possible to get something working before you need to do that.
>
> Static resources can be moved to /public (or /static or /resources or /META-INF/resources) in the classpath root. The same applies to messages.properties (which Spring Boot automatically detects in the root of the classpath).
>
> Vanilla usage of Spring DispatcherServlet and Spring Security should require no further changes. If you have other features in your application (for instance, using other servlets or filters), you may need to add some configuration to your Application context, by replacing those elements from the web.xml, as follows:

-   A \@Bean of type Servlet or ServletRegistrationBean installs that bean in the container as if it were a \<servlet/> and \<servlet-mapping/> in web.xml.

-   A \@Bean of type Filter or FilterRegistrationBean behaves similarly (as a \<filter/> and \<filter- mapping/>).

-   An ApplicationContext in an XML file can be added through an \@ImportResource in your Application. Alternatively, cases where annotation configuration is heavily used already can be recreated in a few lines as \@Bean definitions.

> Once the war file is working, you can make it executable by adding a main method to your
>
> Application, as shown in the following example:
>
> If you intend to start your application as a war or as an executable application, you need to share the customizations of the builder in a method that is both available to the SpringBootServletInitializer callback and in the main method in a class similar to the following:

##### NOTE

> import org.springframework.boot.Banner;
>
> import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication; import org.springframework.boot.builder.SpringApplicationBuilder; import
>
> org.springframework.boot.web.servlet.support.SpringBootServletInitialize r;
>
> \@SpringBootApplication
>
> public class MyApplication extends SpringBootServletInitializer {
>
> \@Override
>
> protected SpringApplicationBuilder configure(SpringApplicationBuilder builder) {
>
> return customizerBuilder(builder);
>
> }
>
> public static void main(String\[\] args) {
>
> customizerBuilder(new SpringApplicationBuilder()).run(args);
>
> }
>
> private static SpringApplicationBuilder customizerBuilder(SpringApplicationBuilder builder) {
>
> return builder.sources(MyApplication.class).bannerMode(Banner.Mode.OFF);
>
> }
>
> }
>
> Applications can fall into more than one category:

-   Servlet 3.0+ applications with no web.xml.

-   Applications with a web.xml.

-   Applications with a context hierarchy.

-   Applications without a context hierarchy.

> All of these should be amenable to translation, but each might require slightly different techniques. Servlet 3.0+ applications might translate pretty easily if they already use the Spring Servlet 3.0+
>
> initializer support classes. Normally, all the code from an existing WebApplicationInitializer can be moved into a SpringBootServletInitializer. If your existing application has more than one ApplicationContext (for example, if it uses AbstractDispatcherServletInitializer) then you might be able to combine all your context sources into a single SpringApplication. The main complication you might encounter is if combining does not work and you need to maintain the context hierarchy. See the [entry on building a hierarchy](\l) for examples. An existing parent context that contains web- specific features usually needs to be broken up so that all the ServletContextAware components are in the child context.
>
> Applications that are not already Spring applications might be convertible to Spring Boot applications, and the previously mentioned guidance may help. However, you may yet encounter problems. In that case, we suggest asking questions on Stack Overflow with a tag of spring-boot.

### Deploying a WAR to WebLogic

> To deploy a Spring Boot application to WebLogic, you must ensure that your servlet initializer **directly** implements WebApplicationInitializer (even if you extend from a base class that already implements it).
>
> A typical initializer for WebLogic should resemble the following example:
>
> If you use Logback, you also need to tell WebLogic to prefer the packaged version rather than the version that was pre-installed with the server. You can do so by adding a WEB-INF/weblogic.xml file with the following contents:

# Appendices

> **Appendix A: Common Application Properties**
>
> Various properties can be specified inside your application.properties file, inside your application.yml file, or as command line switches. This appendix provides a list of common Spring Boot properties and references to the underlying classes that consume them.
>
> **TIP** Spring Boot provides various conversion mechanism with advanced value formatting, make sure to review [the properties conversion section](\l).

##### NOTE

> Property contributions can come from additional jar files on your classpath, so you should not consider this an exhaustive list. Also, you can define your own properties.

> **Appendix B: Configuration Metadata**
>
> Spring Boot jars include metadata files that provide details of all supported configuration properties. The files are designed to let IDE developers offer contextual help and "code completion" as users are working with application.properties or application.yml files.
>
> The majority of the metadata file is generated automatically at compile time by processing all items annotated with \@ConfigurationProperties. However, it is possible to [write part of the metadata](\l) [manually](\l) for corner cases or more advanced use cases.

## Metadata Format

> Configuration metadata files are located inside jars under META-INF/spring-configuration- metadata.json. They use a JSON format with items categorized under either "groups" or "properties" and additional values hints categorized under \"hints\", as shown in the following example:

#### {\"groups\": \[

> {
>
> \"name\": \"server\",
>
> \"type\": \"org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.ServerProperties\", \"sourceType\": \"org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.ServerProperties\"
>
> },
>
> {
>

> Each "property" is a configuration item that the user specifies with a given value. For example, server.port and server.address might be specified in your application.properties/application.yaml, as follows:
>
> *Properties*
>
> *Yaml*
>
> The "groups" are higher level items that do not themselves specify a value but instead provide a contextual grouping for properties. For example, the server.port and server.address properties are part of the server group.

##### NOTE

> It is not required that every "property" has a "group". Some properties might exist in their own right.
>
> Finally, "hints" are additional information used to assist the user in configuring a given property. For example, when a developer is configuring the spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto property, a tool can use the hints to offer some auto-completion help for the none, validate, update, create, and create-drop values.

+--------------+------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| description  | > String   | > A short description of the group that can be displayed to users. If no description is available, it may be omitted.

You can use this attribute to guide the user as to the types of values that they can enter. For consistency, the type of a primitive is specified by using its wrapper counterpart (for example, boolean becomes java.lang.Boolean). Note that this class may be a complex type that gets converted from a String as values are bound. If the type is not known, it may be omitted. |

##### NOTE

> Prior to Spring Boot 1.3, a single deprecated boolean attribute can be used instead of the deprecation element. This is still supported in a deprecated fashion and should no longer be used. If no reason and replacement are available, an empty deprecation object should be set.
>
> Deprecation can also be specified declaratively in code by adding the \@DeprecatedConfigurationProperty annotation to the getter exposing the deprecated property. For instance, assume that the my.app.target property was confusing and was renamed to my.app.name. The following example shows how to handle that situation:

##### NOTE

> There is no way to set a level. warning is always assumed, since code is still handling the property.
>
> The preceding code makes sure that the deprecated property still works (delegating to the name property behind the scenes). Once the getTarget and setTarget methods can be removed from your public API, the automatic deprecation hint in the metadata goes away as well. If you want to keep a hint, adding manual metadata with an error deprecation level ensures that users are still informed about that property. Doing so is particularly useful when a replacement is provided.

### Repeated Metadata Items

> Objects with the same "property" and "group" name can appear multiple times within a metadata file. For example, you could bind two separate classes to the same prefix, with each having potentially overlapping property names. While the same names appearing in the metadata multiple times should not be common, consumers of metadata should take care to ensure that they support it.

## Providing Manual Hints

> To improve the user experience and further assist the user in configuring a given property, you can provide additional metadata that:

-   Describes the list of potential values for a property.

-   Associates a provider, to attach a well defined semantic to a property, so that a tool can discover the list of potential values based on the project's context.

    1.  ### Value Hint

> The name attribute of each hint refers to the name of a property. In the [initial example shown earlier](\l), we provide five values for the spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto property: none, validate, update, create, and create-drop. Each value may have a description as well.
>
> If your property is of type Map, you can provide hints for both the keys and the values (but not for the map itself). The special .keys and .values suffixes must refer to the keys and the values, respectively.
>
> Assume a my.contexts maps magic String values to an integer, as shown in the following example:
>
> The magic values are (in this example) are sample1 and sample2. In order to offer additional content assistance for the keys, you could add the following JSON to [the manual metadata of the module](\l):

##### TIP

> We recommend that you use an Enum for those two values instead. If your IDE supports it, this is by far the most effective approach to auto-completion.

### Value Providers

> Providers are a powerful way to attach semantics to a property. In this section, we define the official providers that you can use for your own hints. However, your favorite IDE may implement some of these or none of them. Also, it could eventually provide its own.
>
> **NOTE** As this is a new feature, IDE vendors must catch up with how it works. Adoption times naturally vary.
>
> The following table summarizes the list of supported providers:

----------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Name**                **Description**

  any                     Permits any additional value to be provided.

  class-reference         Auto-completes the classes available in the project. Usually constrained by a base class that is specified by the target parameter.

  handle-as               Handles the property as if it were defined by the type defined by the mandatory target parameter.

  logger-name             Auto-completes valid logger names and [logger groups](\l). Typically, package and class names available in the current project can be auto-completed as well as defined groups.

  spring-bean-reference   Auto-completes the available bean names in the current project. Usually constrained by a base class that is specified by the target parameter.

  spring-profile-name     Auto-completes the available Spring profile names in the project.
----------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### TIP

> Only one provider can be active for a given property, but you can specify several providers if they can all manage the property *in some way*. Make sure to place the most powerful provider first, as the IDE must use the first one in the JSON section that it can handle. If no provider for a given property is supported, no special content assistance is provided, either.

##### Any

> The special **any** provider value permits any additional values to be provided. Regular value validation based on the property type should be applied if this is supported.
>
> This provider is typically used if you have a list of values and any extra values should still be considered as valid.
>
> The following example offers on and off as auto-completion values for system.state:
>
> Note that, in the preceding example, any other value is also allowed.

##### Class Reference

> The **class-reference** provider auto-completes classes available in the project. This provider supports the following parameters:

+---------------+----------+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Parameter** | **Type** | **Default value** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
+---------------+----------+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| target        | String   | *none*            | The fully qualified name of the class that should be assignable to the chosen value. Typically used to filter out-non candidate classes. Note that this information can be provided by the type itself by exposing a class with the appropriate upper bound. |
|               |          |                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

##### Handle As

> The **handle-as** provider lets you substitute the type of the property to a more high-level type. This typically happens when the property has a java.lang.String type, because you do not want your configuration classes to rely on classes that may not be on the classpath. This provider supports the following parameters:

+---------------+----------+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Parameter** | **Type** | **Default value** | **Description**                                                                                 |
+---------------+----------+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| target        | String   | *none*            | The fully qualified name of the type to consider for the property. This parameter is mandatory. |
|               |          |                   |                                                                                                 |
|               | (Class)  |                   |                                                                                                 |
+---------------+----------+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

> The following types can be used:

-   Any java.lang.Enum: Lists the possible values for the property. (We recommend defining the property with the Enum type, as no further hint should be required for the IDE to auto-complete the values)

-   java.nio.charset.Charset: Supports auto-completion of charset/encoding values (such as UTF-8)

-   java.util.Locale: auto-completion of locales (such as en_US)

-   org.springframework.util.MimeType: Supports auto-completion of content type values (such as

> text/plain)

-   org.springframework.core.io.Resource: Supports auto-completion of Spring's Resource abstraction to refer to a file on the filesystem or on the classpath (such as classpath:/sample.properties)

> **TIP** If multiple values can be provided, use a Collection or *Array* type to teach the IDE about it.
>
> The following metadata snippet corresponds to the standard spring.liquibase.change-log property that defines the path to the changelog to use. It is actually used internally as a org.springframework.core.io.Resource but cannot be exposed as such, because we need to keep the original String value to pass it to the Liquibase API.

##### Logger Name

> The **logger-name** provider auto-completes valid logger names and [logger groups](\l). Typically, package and class names available in the current project can be auto-completed. If groups are enabled (default) and if a custom logger group is identified in the configuration, auto-completion for it should be provided. Specific frameworks may have extra magic logger names that can be supported as well.
>
> This provider supports the following parameters:

--------------- ---------- ------------------- ----------------------------------------------------
  **Parameter**   **Type**   **Default value**   **Description**

  group           boolean    true                Specify whether known groups should be considered.
--------------- ---------- ------------------- ----------------------------------------------------

> Since a logger name can be any arbitrary name, this provider should allow any value but could highlight valid package and class names that are not available in the project's classpath.
>
> The following metadata snippet corresponds to the standard logging.level property. Keys are *logger names*, and values correspond to the standard log levels or any custom level. As Spring Boot defines a few logger groups out-of-the-box, dedicated value hints have been added for those.

> The following metadata snippet corresponds to the standard spring.jmx.server property that defines the name of the MBeanServer bean to use:

##### NOTE

> The binder is not aware of the metadata. If you provide that hint, you still need to transform the bean name into an actual Bean reference using by the ApplicationContext.

## Generating Your Own Metadata by Using the Annotation Processor

> You can easily generate your own configuration metadata file from items annotated with \@ConfigurationProperties by using the spring-boot-configuration-processor jar. The jar includes a Java annotation processor which is invoked as your project is compiled.

### Configuring the Annotation Processor

> To use the processor, include a dependency on spring-boot-configuration-processor.
>
> With Maven the dependency should be declared as optional, as shown in the following example:
>
> With Gradle, the dependency should be declared in the annotationProcessor configuration, as shown in the following example:
>
> If you are using an additional-spring-configuration-metadata.json file, the compileJava task should be configured to depend on the processResources task, as shown in the following example:
>
> This dependency ensures that the additional metadata is available when the annotation processor runs during compilation.
>
> If you are using AspectJ in your project, you need to make sure that the annotation processor runs only once. There are several ways to do this. With Maven, you can configure the maven-apt-plugin explicitly and add the dependency to the annotation processor only there. You could also let the AspectJ plugin run all the processing and disable annotation processing in the maven-compiler-plugin configuration, as follows:

##### NOTE

2.  **Automatic Metadata Generation**

> The processor picks up both classes and methods that are annotated with \@ConfigurationProperties.
>
> If the class is also annotated with \@ConstructorBinding, a single constructor is expected and one property is created per constructor parameter. Otherwise, properties are discovered through the presence of standard getters and setters with special handling for collection and map types (that is detected even if only a getter is present). The annotation processor also supports the use of the \@Data, \@Getter, and \@Setter lombok annotations.

> populate the description attribute. For instance, the description of my.server.ip is \"IP address to listen to.\".
>
> **NOTE** You should only use plain text with \@ConfigurationProperties field Javadoc, since they are not processed before being added to the JSON.
>
> The annotation processor applies a number of heuristics to extract the default value from the source model. Default values have to be provided statically. In particular, do not refer to a constant defined in another class. Also, the annotation processor cannot auto-detect default values for Enums and Collectionss.
>
> For cases where the default value could not be detected, [manual metadata](\l) should be provided. Consider the following example:

#### import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.Arrays; import java.util.List;

> import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties; \@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = \"my.messaging\")
>
> public class MyMessagingProperties {
>
> private List\<String> addresses = new ArrayList\<\>(Arrays.asList(\"a\", \"b\")); private ContainerType containerType = ContainerType.SIMPLE;
>
> public List\<String> getAddresses() { return this.addresses;
>
> }
>
> public void setAddresses(List\<String> addresses) { this.addresses = addresses;
>
> }
>
> public ContainerType getContainerType() { return this.containerType;
>
> }
>
> public void setContainerType(ContainerType containerType) { this.containerType = containerType;
>
> }
>
> public enum ContainerType { SIMPLE, DIRECT
>
> }
>
> }
>
> In order to document default values for properties in the class above, you could add the following content to [the manual metadata of the module](\l):

##### NOTE

> Only the name of the property is required to document additional metadata for existing properties.

##### Nested Properties

> The annotation processor automatically considers inner classes as nested properties. Rather than documenting the ip and port at the root of the namespace, we could create a sub-namespace for it. Consider the updated example:

#### import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties;

> \@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = \"my.server\") public class MyServerProperties {
>
> private String name; private Host host;
>
> public String getName() { return this.name;
>
> }
>
> public void setName(String name) { this.name = name;
>
> }
>
> public Host getHost() { return this.host;
>
> }
>
> public void setHost(Host host) { this.host = host;
>
> }
>
> public static class Host { private String ip; private int port; public String getIp() {
>
> return this.ip;
>
> }
>
> public void setIp(String ip) { this.ip = ip;
>
> }
>
> public int getPort() { return this.port;
>
> }
>
> public void setPort(int port) { this.port = port;
>
> }
>
> }
>
> }
>
> The preceding example produces metadata information for my.server.name, my.server.host.ip, and my.server.host.port properties. You can use the \@NestedConfigurationProperty annotation on a field to indicate that a regular (non-inner) class should be treated as if it were nested.
>
> **TIP** This has no effect on collections and maps, as those types are automatically identified, and a single metadata property is generated for each of them.

### Adding Additional Metadata

> Spring Boot's configuration file handling is quite flexible, and it is often the case that properties may exist that are not bound to a \@ConfigurationProperties bean. You may also need to tune some attributes of an existing key. To support such cases and let you provide custom \"hints\", the annotation processor automatically merges items from META-INF/additional-spring-configuration- metadata.json into the main metadata file.
>
> If you refer to a property that has been detected automatically, the description, default value, and deprecation information are overridden, if specified. If the manual property declaration is not identified in the current module, it is added as a new property.
>
> The format of the additional-spring-configuration-metadata.json file is exactly the same as the regular spring-configuration-metadata.json. The additional properties file is optional. If you do not have any additional properties, do not add the file.

# Appendix C: Auto-configuration Classes

> This appendix contains details of all of the auto-configuration classes provided by Spring Boot, with links to documentation and source code. Remember to also look at the conditions report in your application for more details of which features are switched on. (To do so, start the app with \--debug or -Ddebug or, in an Actuator application, use the conditions endpoint).

# Appendix E: The Executable Jar Format

> The spring-boot-loader modules lets Spring Boot support executable jar and war files. If you use the Maven plugin or the Gradle plugin, executable jars are automatically generated, and you generally do not need to know the details of how they work.
>
> If you need to create executable jars from a different build system or if you are just curious about the underlying technology, this appendix provides some background.

## Nested JARs

> Java does not provide any standard way to load nested jar files (that is, jar files that are themselves contained within a jar). This can be problematic if you need to distribute a self-contained application that can be run from the command line without unpacking.
>
> To solve this problem, many developers use "shaded" jars. A shaded jar packages all classes, from all jars, into a single "uber jar". The problem with shaded jars is that it becomes hard to see which libraries are actually in your application. It can also be problematic if the same filename is used (but with different content) in multiple jars. Spring Boot takes a different approach and lets you actually nest jars directly.

### The Executable Jar File Structure

> Spring Boot Loader-compatible jar files should be structured in the following way:
>
> Application classes should be placed in a nested BOOT-INF/classes directory. Dependencies should be placed in a nested BOOT-INF/lib directory.

### The Executable War File Structure

> Spring Boot Loader-compatible war files should be structured in the following way:
>
> Dependencies should be placed in a nested WEB-INF/lib directory. Any dependencies that are required when running embedded but are not required when deploying to a traditional web container should be placed in WEB-INF/lib-provided.

### Index Files

> Spring Boot Loader-compatible jar and war archives can include additional index files under the BOOT-INF/ directory. A classpath.idx file can be provided for both jars and wars, and it provides the ordering that jars should be added to the classpath. The layers.idx file can be used only for jars, and it allows a jar to be split into logical layers for Docker/OCI image creation.
>
> Index files follow a YAML compatible syntax so that they can be easily parsed by third-party tools. These files, however, are *not* parsed internally as YAML and they must be written in exactly the formats described below in order to be used.

### Classpath Index

> The classpath index file can be provided in BOOT-INF/classpath.idx. It provides a list of jar names (including the directory) in the order that they should be added to the classpath. Each line must start with dash space (\"-·\") and names must be in double quotes.
>
> For example, given the following jar:
>
> The index file would look like this:

### Layer Index

> The layers index file can be provided in BOOT-INF/layers.idx. It provides a list of layers and the parts of the jar that should be contained within them. Layers are written in the order that they should be added to the Docker/OCI image. Layers names are written as quoted strings prefixed with dash space (\"-·\") and with a colon (\":\") suffix. Layer content is either a file or directory name written as a quoted string prefixed by space space dash space (\"··-·\"). A directory name ends with
>
> /, a file name does not. When a directory name is used it means that all files inside that directory are in the same layer.
>
> A typical example of a layers index would be:

## Spring Boot's "JarFile" Class

> The core class used to support loading nested jars is org.springframework.boot.loader.jar.JarFile. It lets you load jar content from a standard jar file or from nested child jar data. When first loaded, the location of each JarEntry is mapped to a physical file offset of the outer jar, as shown in the following example:
>
> The preceding example shows how A.class can be found in /BOOT-INF/classes in myapp.jar at position 0063. B.class from the nested jar can actually be found in myapp.jar at position 3452, and C.class is at position 3980.
>
> Armed with this information, we can load specific nested entries by seeking to the appropriate part of the outer jar. We do not need to unpack the archive, and we do not need to read all entry data into memory.

### Compatibility with the Standard Java "JarFile"

> Spring Boot Loader strives to remain compatible with existing code and libraries. org.springframework.boot.loader.jar.JarFile extends from java.util.jar.JarFile and should work as a drop-in replacement. The getURL() method returns a URL that opens a connection compatible with java.net.JarURLConnection and can be used with Java's URLClassLoader.

## Launching Executable Jars

> The org.springframework.boot.loader.Launcher class is a special bootstrap class that is used as an executable jar's main entry point. It is the actual Main-Class in your jar file, and it is used to setup an appropriate URLClassLoader and ultimately call your main() method.
>
> There are three launcher subclasses (JarLauncher, WarLauncher, and PropertiesLauncher). Their purpose is to load resources (.class files and so on) from nested jar files or war files in directories (as opposed to those explicitly on the classpath). In the case of JarLauncher and WarLauncher, the nested paths are fixed. JarLauncher looks in BOOT-INF/lib/, and WarLauncher looks in WEB-INF/lib/ and WEB-INF/lib-provided/. You can add extra jars in those locations if you want more. The PropertiesLauncher looks in BOOT-INF/lib/ in your application archive by default. You can add additional locations by setting an environment variable called LOADER_PATH or loader.path in loader.properties (which is a comma-separated list of directories, archives, or directories within archives).

### Launcher Manifest

> You need to specify an appropriate Launcher as the Main-Class attribute of META-INF/MANIFEST.MF. The actual class that you want to launch (that is, the class that contains a main method) should be specified in the Start-Class attribute.
>
> The following example shows a typical MANIFEST.MF for an executable jar file:
>
> For a war file, it would be as follows:

##### NOTE

> You need not specify Class-Path entries in your manifest file. The classpath is deduced from the nested jars.

## PropertiesLauncher Features

> PropertiesLauncher has a few special features that can be enabled with external properties (System properties, environment variables, manifest entries, or loader.properties). The following table describes these properties:

> When specified as environment variables or manifest entries, the following names should be used:

------------------------ ------------------------ --------------------------
  **Key**                  **Manifest entry**       **Environment variable**

  loader.path              Loader-Path              LOADER_PATH

  loader.home              Loader-Home              LOADER_HOME

  loader.args              Loader-Args              LOADER_ARGS

  loader.main              Start-Class              LOADER_MAIN

  loader.config.location   Loader-Config-Location   LOADER_CONFIG_LOCATION

  loader.system            Loader-System            LOADER_SYSTEM
------------------------ ------------------------ --------------------------

##### TIP

> Build plugins automatically move the Main-Class attribute to Start-Class when the fat jar is built. If you use that, specify the name of the class to launch by using the Main- Class attribute and leaving out Start-Class.
>
> The following rules apply to working with PropertiesLauncher:

-   loader.properties is searched for in loader.home, then in the root of the classpath, and then in

> classpath:/BOOT-INF/classes. The first location where a file with that name exists is used.

-   loader.home is the directory location of an additional properties file (overriding the default) only when loader.config.location is not specified.

-   loader.path can contain directories (which are scanned recursively for jar and zip files), archive paths, a directory within an archive that is scanned for jar files (for example, dependencies.jar!/lib), or wildcard patterns (for the default JVM behavior). Archive paths can be relative to loader.home or anywhere in the file system with a jar:file: prefix.

-   loader.path (if empty) defaults to BOOT-INF/lib (meaning a local directory or a nested one if running from an archive). Because of this, PropertiesLauncher behaves the same as JarLauncher when no additional configuration is provided.

-   loader.path can not be used to configure the location of loader.properties (the classpath used to search for the latter is the JVM classpath when PropertiesLauncher is launched).

-   Placeholder replacement is done from System and environment variables plus the properties file itself on all values before use.

-   The search order for properties (where it makes sense to look in more than one place) is environment variables, system properties, loader.properties, the exploded archive manifest, and the archive manifest.

    1.  ## Executable Jar Restrictions

> You need to consider the following restrictions when working with a Spring Boot Loader packaged application:

-   Zip entry compression: The ZipEntry for a nested jar must be saved by using the ZipEntry.STORED method. This is required so that we can seek directly to individual content within the nested jar. The content of the nested jar file itself can still be compressed, as can any other entries in the outer jar.

-   System classLoader: Launched applications should use Thread.getContextClassLoader() when loading classes (most libraries and frameworks do so by default). Trying to load nested jar classes with ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader() fails. java.util.Logging always uses the system classloader. For this reason, you should consider a different logging implementation.

    1.  ## Alternative Single Jar Solutions

> If the preceding restrictions mean that you cannot use Spring Boot Loader, consider the following alternatives:

-   Maven Shade Plugin

-   JarClassLoader

-   OneJar

-   Gradle Shadow Plugin

# Appendix F: Dependency Versions

> This appendix provides details of the dependencies that are managed by Spring Boot.

## Managed Dependency Coordinates

> The following table provides details of all of the dependency versions that are provided by Spring Boot in its CLI (Command Line Interface), Maven dependency management, and Gradle plugin. When you declare a dependency on one of these artifacts without declaring a version, the version listed in the table is used.
