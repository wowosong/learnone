## Map

The central class of the API — it is used to create a map on a page and manipulate it.

### Usage example

```javascript
// initialize the map on the "map" div with a given center and zoom
var map = L.map('map', {
    center: [51.505, -0.09],
    zoom: 13
});
```

### Creation

| Factory | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `L.map(<String> _id_, <Map options> _options?_)` | Instantiates a map object given the DOM ID of a `<div>` element and optionally an object literal with `Map options`. |
| `L.map(<HTMLElement> _el_, <Map options> _options?_)` | Instantiates a map object given an instance of a `<div>` HTML element and optionally an object literal with `Map options`. |

### Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `preferCanvas` | `Boolean` | `false` | Whether [`Path`](#path)s should be rendered on a [`Canvas`](#canvas) renderer. By default, all [`Path`](#path)s are rendered in a [`SVG`](#svg) renderer. |

#### Control options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `attributionControl` | `Boolean` | `true` | Whether a [attribution control](#control-attribution) is added to the map by default. |
| `zoomControl` | `Boolean` | `true` | Whether a [zoom control](#control-zoom) is added to the map by default. |

#### Interaction Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `closePopupOnClick` | `Boolean` | `true` | Set it to `false` if you don't want popups to close when user clicks the map. |
| `boxZoom` | `Boolean` | `true` | Whether the map can be zoomed to a rectangular area specified by dragging the mouse while pressing the shift key. |
| `doubleClickZoom` | `Boolean|String` | `true` | Whether the map can be zoomed in by double clicking on it and zoomed out by double clicking while holding shift. If passed `'center'`, double-click zoom will zoom to the center of the view regardless of where the mouse was. |
| `dragging` | `Boolean` | `true` | Whether the map is draggable with mouse/touch or not. |
| `zoomSnap` | `Number` | `1` | Forces the map's zoom level to always be a multiple of this, particularly right after a [`fitBounds()`](#map-fitbounds) or a pinch-zoom. By default, the zoom level snaps to the nearest integer; lower values (e.g. `0.5` or `0.1`) allow for greater granularity. A value of `0` means the zoom level will not be snapped after `fitBounds` or a pinch-zoom. |
| `zoomDelta` | `Number` | `1` | Controls how much the map's zoom level will change after a [`zoomIn()`](#map-zoomin), [`zoomOut()`](#map-zoomout), pressing `+` or `-` on the keyboard, or using the [zoom controls](#control-zoom). Values smaller than `1` (e.g. `0.5`) allow for greater granularity. |
| `trackResize` | `Boolean` | `true` | Whether the map automatically handles browser window resize to update itself. |

#### Panning Inertia Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `inertia` | `Boolean` | `*` | If enabled, panning of the map will have an inertia effect where the map builds momentum while dragging and continues moving in the same direction for some time. Feels especially nice on touch devices. Enabled by default. |
| `inertiaDeceleration` | `Number` | `3000` | The rate with which the inertial movement slows down, in pixels/second². |
| `inertiaMaxSpeed` | `Number` | `Infinity` | Max speed of the inertial movement, in pixels/second. |
| `easeLinearity` | `Number` | `0.2` |  |
| `worldCopyJump` | `Boolean` | `false` | With this option enabled, the map tracks when you pan to another "copy" of the world and seamlessly jumps to the original one so that all overlays like markers and vector layers are still visible. |
| `maxBoundsViscosity` | `Number` | `0.0` | If `maxBounds` is set, this option will control how solid the bounds are when dragging the map around. The default value of `0.0` allows the user to drag outside the bounds at normal speed, higher values will slow down map dragging outside bounds, and `1.0` makes the bounds fully solid, preventing the user from dragging outside the bounds. |

#### Keyboard Navigation Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `keyboard` | `Boolean` | `true` | Makes the map focusable and allows users to navigate the map with keyboard arrows and `+`/`-` keys. |
| `keyboardPanDelta` | `Number` | `80` | Amount of pixels to pan when pressing an arrow key. |

#### Mouse wheel options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `scrollWheelZoom` | `Boolean|String` | `true` | Whether the map can be zoomed by using the mouse wheel. If passed `'center'`, it will zoom to the center of the view regardless of where the mouse was. |
| `wheelDebounceTime` | `Number` | `40` | Limits the rate at which a wheel can fire (in milliseconds). By default user can't zoom via wheel more often than once per 40 ms. |
| `wheelPxPerZoomLevel` | `Number` | `60` | How many scroll pixels (as reported by [L.DomEvent.getWheelDelta](#domevent-getwheeldelta)) mean a change of one full zoom level. Smaller values will make wheel-zooming faster (and vice versa). |

#### Touch interaction options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tapHold` | `Boolean` |  | Enables simulation of `contextmenu` event, default is `true` for mobile Safari. |
| `tapTolerance` | `Number` | `15` | The max number of pixels a user can shift his finger during touch for it to be considered a valid tap. |
| `touchZoom` | `Boolean|String` | `*` | Whether the map can be zoomed by touch-dragging with two fingers. If passed `'center'`, it will zoom to the center of the view regardless of where the touch events (fingers) were. Enabled for touch-capable web browsers. |
| `bounceAtZoomLimits` | `Boolean` | `true` | Set it to false if you don't want the map to zoom beyond min/max zoom and then bounce back when pinch-zooming. |

#### Map State Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `crs` | `[CRS](#crs)` | `L.CRS.EPSG3857` | The [Coordinate Reference System](#crs) to use. Don't change this if you're not sure what it means. |

| `zoom` | `Number` | `undefined` | Initial map zoom level |
| `minZoom` | `Number` | `*` | Minimum zoom level of the map. If not specified and at least one [`GridLayer`](#gridlayer) or [`TileLayer`](#tilelayer) is in the map, the lowest of their `minZoom` options will be used instead. |
| `maxZoom` | `Number` | `*` | Maximum zoom level of the map. If not specified and at least one [`GridLayer`](#gridlayer) or [`TileLayer`](#tilelayer) is in the map, the highest of their `maxZoom` options will be used instead. |
| `layers` | `Layer[]` | `[]` | Array of layers that will be added to the map initially |
| `maxBounds` | `[LatLngBounds](#latlngbounds)` | `null` | When this option is set, the map restricts the view to the given geographical bounds, bouncing the user back if the user tries to pan outside the view. To set the restriction dynamically, use [`setMaxBounds`](#map-setmaxbounds) method. |
| `renderer` | `[Renderer](#renderer)` | `*` | The default method for drawing vector layers on the map. [`L.SVG`](#svg) or [`L.Canvas`](#canvas) by default depending on browser support. |

#### Animation Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `zoomAnimation` | `Boolean` | `true` | Whether the map zoom animation is enabled. By default it's enabled in all browsers that support CSS3 Transitions except Android. |
| `zoomAnimationThreshold` | `Number` | `4` | Won't animate zoom if the zoom difference exceeds this value. |
| `fadeAnimation` | `Boolean` | `true` | Whether the tile fade animation is enabled. By default it's enabled in all browsers that support CSS3 Transitions except Android. |
| `markerZoomAnimation` | `Boolean` | `true` | Whether markers animate their zoom with the zoom animation, if disabled they will disappear for the length of the animation. By default it's enabled in all browsers that support CSS3 Transitions except Android. |
| `transform3DLimit` | `Number` | `2^23` | Defines the maximum size of a CSS translation transform. The default value should not be changed unless a web browser positions layers in the wrong place after doing a large `panBy`. |

| `getCenter()` | `[LatLng](#latlng)` ||
|Returns the geographical center of the map view|||

 |
| `getZoom()` | `Number` | 

Returns the current zoom level of the map view

 |
| `getBounds()` | `[LatLngBounds](#latlngbounds)` | 

Returns the geographical bounds visible in the current map view

 |

### Locate options

Some of the geolocation methods for [`Map`](#map) take in an `options` parameter. This is a plain javascript object with the following optional components:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `watch` | `Boolean` | `false` | If `true`, starts continuous watching of location changes (instead of detecting it once) using W3C `watchPosition` method. You can later stop watching using `map.stopLocate()` method. |

### Pan options

Some of the [`Map`](#map) methods which modify the center of the map take in an `options` parameter. This is a plain javascript object with the following optional components:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `animate` | `Boolean` |  | If `true`, panning will always be animated if possible. If `false`, it will not animate panning, either resetting the map view if panning more than a screen away, or just setting a new offset for the map pane (except for `panBy` which always does the latter). |
| `duration` | `Number` | `0.25` | Duration of animated panning, in seconds. |
| `easeLinearity` | `Number` | `0.25` | The curvature factor of panning animation easing (third parameter of the [Cubic Bezier curve](https://cubic-bezier.com/)). 1.0 means linear animation, and the smaller this number, the more bowed the curve. |
| `noMoveStart` | `Boolean` | `false` | If `true`, panning won't fire `movestart` event on start (used internally for panning inertia). |

## Popup

Used to open popups in certain places of the map. Use [Map.openPopup](#map-openpopup) to open popups while making sure that only one popup is open at one time (recommended for usability), or use [Map.addLayer](#map-addlayer) to open as many as you want.

### Usage example

If you want to just bind a popup to marker click and then open it, it's really easy:

```javascript
marker.bindPopup(popupContent).openPopup();
```

Path overlays like polylines also have a `bindPopup` method.

A popup can be also standalone:

```javascript
var popup = L.popup()
    .setLatLng(latlng)
    .setContent('<p>Hello world!<br />This is a nice popup.</p>')
    .openOn(map);
```

or

```javascript
var popup = L.popup(latlng, {content: '<p>Hello world!<br />This is a nice popup.</p>'})
    .openOn(map);
```

### Creation

| `maxWidth` | `Number` | `300` | Max width of the popup, in pixels. |
| `minWidth` | `Number` | `50` | Min width of the popup, in pixels. |
| `maxHeight` | `Number` | `null` | If set, creates a scrollable container of the given height inside a popup if its content exceeds it. The scrollable container can be styled using the `leaflet-popup-scrolled` CSS class selector. |

## Tooltip

Used to display small texts on top of map layers.

### Usage example

If you want to just bind a tooltip to marker:

```javascript
marker.bindTooltip("my tooltip text").openTooltip();
```

Path overlays like polylines also have a `bindTooltip` method.

A tooltip can be also standalone:

```javascript
var tooltip = L.tooltip()
    .setLatLng(latlng)
    .setContent('Hello world!<br />This is a nice tooltip.')
    .addTo(map);
```

or

```javascript
var tooltip = L.tooltip(latlng, {content: 'Hello world!<br />This is a nice tooltip.'})
    .addTo(map);
```

Note about tooltip offset. Leaflet takes two options in consideration for computing tooltip offsetting:

*   the `offset` Tooltip option: it defaults to \[0, 0\], and it's specific to one tooltip. Add a positive x offset to move the tooltip to the right, and a positive y offset to move it to the bottom. Negatives will move to the left and top.
*   the `tooltipAnchor` Icon option: this will only be considered for Marker. You should adapt this value if you use a custom icon.

### Creation

| --- | --- |
| `L.tooltip(<[Tooltip options](#tooltip-option)> _options?_, <[Layer](#layer)> _source?_)` | Instantiates a [`Tooltip`](#tooltip) object given an optional `options` object that describes its appearance and location and an optional `source` object that is used to tag the tooltip with a reference to the Layer to which it refers. |
| `L.tooltip(<[LatLng](#latlng)> _latlng_, <[Tooltip options](#tooltip-option)> _options?_)` | Instantiates a [`Tooltip`](#tooltip) object given `latlng` where the tooltip will open and an optional `options` object that describes its appearance and location. |

### Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pane` | `String` | `'tooltipPane'` | `Map pane` where the tooltip will be added. |
| `offset` | `[Point](#point)` | `Point(0, 0)` | Optional offset of the tooltip position. |
| `direction` | `String` | `'auto'` | Direction where to open the tooltip. Possible values are: `right`, `left`, `top`, `bottom`, `center`, `auto`. `auto` will dynamically switch between `right` and `left` according to the tooltip position on the map. |
| `permanent` | `Boolean` | `false` | Whether to open the tooltip permanently or only on mouseover. |
| `sticky` | `Boolean` | `false` | If true, the tooltip will follow the mouse instead of being fixed at the feature center. |
| `opacity` | `Number` | `0.9` | Tooltip container opacity. |

## TileLayer

Used to load and display tile layers on the map. Note that most tile servers require attribution, which you can set under [`Layer`](#layer). Extends [`GridLayer`](#gridlayer).

### Usage example

```javascript
L.tileLayer('https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png?{foo}', {foo: 'bar', attribution: '&copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'}).addTo(map);
```

#### URL template

A string of the following form:

```javascript
'https://{s}.somedomain.com/blabla/{z}/{x}/{y}{r}.png'
```

`{s}` means one of the available subdomains (used sequentially to help with browser parallel requests per domain limitation; subdomain values are specified in options; `a`, `b` or `c` by default, can be omitted), `{z}` — zoom level, `{x}` and `{y}` — tile coordinates. `{r}` can be used to add "@2x" to the URL to load retina tiles.

You can use custom keys in the template, which will be [evaluated](#util-template) from TileLayer options, like this:

```javascript
L.tileLayer('https://{s}.somedomain.com/{foo}/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {foo: 'bar'});
```

### Creation

#### Extension methods

| `zoomReverse` | `Boolean` | `false` | If set to true, the zoom number used in tile URLs will be reversed (`maxZoom - zoom` instead of `zoom`) |
| `detectRetina` | `Boolean` | `false` | If `true` and user is on a retina display, it will request four tiles of half the specified size and a bigger zoom level in place of one to utilize the high resolution. |
| `crossOrigin` | `Boolean|String` | `false` | Whether the crossOrigin attribute will be added to the tiles. If a String is provided, all tiles will have their crossOrigin attribute set to the String provided. This is needed if you want to access tile pixel data.

## Polygon

A class for drawing polygon overlays on a map. Extends [`Polyline`](#polyline).

Note that points you pass when creating a polygon shouldn't have an additional last point equal to the first one — it's better to filter out such points.

### Usage example

```javascript
// create a red polygon from an array of LatLng points
var latlngs = [[37, -109.05],[41, -109.03],[41, -102.05],[37, -102.04]];

var polygon = L.polygon(latlngs, {color: 'red'}).addTo(map);

// zoom the map to the polygon
map.fitBounds(polygon.getBounds());
```

You can also pass an array of arrays of latlngs, with the first array representing the outer shape and the other arrays representing holes in the outer shape:

```javascript
var latlngs = [
  [[37, -109.05],[41, -109.03],[41, -102.05],[37, -102.04]], // outer ring
  [[37.29, -108.58],[40.71, -108.58],[40.71, -102.50],[37.29, -102.50]] // hole
];
```

Additionally, you can pass a multi-dimensional array to represent a MultiPolygon shape.

```javascript
var latlngs = [
  [ // first polygon
    [[37, -109.05],[41, -109.03],[41, -102.05],[37, -102.04]], // outer ring
    [[37.29, -108.58],[40.71, -108.58],[40.71, -102.50],[37.29, -102.50]] // hole
  ],
  [ // second polygon
    [[41, -111.03],[45, -111.04],[45, -104.05],[41, -104.05]]
  ]

## SVG

Allows vector layers to be displayed with [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/SVG). Inherits [`Renderer`](#renderer).

Due to [technical limitations](https://caniuse.com/svg), SVG is not available in all web browsers, notably Android 2.x and 3.x.

Although SVG is not available on IE7 and IE8, these browsers support [VML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_Markup_Language) (a now deprecated technology), and the SVG renderer will fall back to VML in this case.

VML was deprecated in 2012, which means VML functionality exists only for backwards compatibility with old versions of Internet Explorer.

### Usage example

Use SVG by default for all paths in the map:

```javascript
var map = L.map('map', {
    renderer: L.svg()
});
```

Use a SVG renderer with extra padding for specific vector geometries:

```javascript
var map = L.map('map');
var myRenderer = L.svg({ padding: 0.5 });
var line = L.polyline( coordinates, { renderer: myRenderer } );
var circle = L.circle( center, { renderer: myRenderer } );
```

### Creation

| Factory | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `L.svg(<[Renderer options](#renderer-option)> _options?_)` | Creates a SVG renderer with the given options. |

### Functions

There are several static functions which can be called without instantiating L.SVG:

| Function | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `create(<String> _name_)` | `SVGElement` | Returns a instance of [SVGElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/SVGElement), corresponding to the class name passed. For example, using 'line' will return an instance of [SVGLineElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/SVGLineElement). |
| `pointsToPath(<Point[]> _rings_, <Boolean> _closed_)` | `String` | Generates a SVG path string for multiple rings, with each ring turning into "M..L..L.." instructions |

## Canvas

Allows vector layers to be displayed with [`<canvas>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API). Inherits [`Renderer`](#renderer).

Due to [technical limitations](https://caniuse.com/canvas), Canvas is not available in all web browsers, notably IE8, and overlapping geometries might not display properly in some edge cases.

### Usage example

Use Canvas by default for all paths in the map:

```javascript
var map = L.map('map', {
    renderer: L.canvas()
});
```

Use a Canvas renderer with extra padding for specific vector geometries:

```javascript
var map = L.map('map');
var myRenderer = L.canvas({ padding: 0.5 });
var line = L.polyline( coordinates, { renderer: myRenderer } );
var circle = L.circle( center, { renderer: myRenderer } );
```

## FeatureGroup

Extended [`LayerGroup`](#layergroup) that makes it easier to do the same thing to all its member layers:

*   [`bindPopup`](#layer-bindpopup) binds a popup to all of the layers at once (likewise with [`bindTooltip`](#layer-bindtooltip))
*   Events are propagated to the [`FeatureGroup`](#featuregroup), so if the group has an event handler, it will handle events from any of the layers. This includes mouse events and custom events.
*   Has `layeradd` and `layerremove` events

### Usage example

```javascript
L.featureGroup([marker1, marker2, polyline])
    .bindPopup('Hello world!')
    .on('click', function() { alert('Clicked on a member of the group!'); })

## GeoJSON

Represents a GeoJSON object or an array of GeoJSON objects. Allows you to parse GeoJSON data and display it on the map. Extends [`FeatureGroup`](#featuregroup).

### Usage example

```javascript
L.geoJSON(data, {
    style: function (feature) {
        return {color: feature.properties.color};
    }
}).bindPopup(function (layer) {
    return layer.feature.properties.description;
}).addTo(map);
```

### Creation

| Factory | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `L.geoJSON(<Object> _geojson?_, <[GeoJSON options](#geojson-option)> _options?_)` | Creates a GeoJSON layer. Optionally accepts an object in [GeoJSON format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946) to display on the map (you can alternatively add it later with `addData` method) and an `options` object. |

### Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pointToLayer` | `Function` | `*` | A `Function` defining how GeoJSON points spawn Leaflet layers. It is internally called when data is added, passing the GeoJSON point feature and its [`LatLng`](#latlng). The default is to spawn a default [`Marker`](#marker):|
```javascript
function(geoJsonPoint, latlng) {
    return L.marker(latlng);
}
```



 |
| `style` | `Function` | `*` | A `Function` defining the [`Path options`](#path-option) for styling GeoJSON lines and polygons, called internally when data is added. The default value is to not override any defaults:

```javascript
function (geoJsonFeature) {
    return {}
}
```



 |
| `onEachFeature` | `Function` | `*` | A `Function` that will be called once for each created `Feature`, after it has been created and styled. Useful for attaching events and popups to features. The default is to do nothing with the newly created layers:

```javascript
function (feature, layer) {}
```



 |
| `filter` | `Function` | `*` | A `Function` that will be used to decide whether to include a feature or not. The default is to include all features:

```javascript
function (geoJsonFeature) {
    return true;
}
```

Note: dynamically changing the `filter` option will have effect only on newly added data. It will _not_ re-evaluate already included features.

 |
| `coordsToLatLng` | `Function` | `*` | A `Function` that will be used for converting GeoJSON coordinates to [`LatLng`](#latlng)s. The default is the `coordsToLatLng` static method. |
| `markersInheritOptions` | `Boolean` | `false` | Whether default Markers for "Point" type Features inherit from group options. |

▶ Methods inherited from [Layer](#layer)

▶ Popup methods inherited from [Layer](#layer)

▶ Tooltip methods inherited from [Layer](#layer)

▶ Methods inherited from [Evented](#evented)

### Functions

There are several static functions which can be called without instantiating L.GeoJSON:

| Function | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `geometryToLayer(<Object> _featureData_, <[GeoJSON options](#geojson-option)> _options?_)` | `[Layer](#layer)` | Creates a [`Layer`](#layer) from a given GeoJSON feature. Can use a custom [`pointToLayer`](#geojson-pointtolayer) and/or [`coordsToLatLng`](#geojson-coordstolatlng) functions if provided as options. |
| `coordsToLatLng(<Array> _coords_)` | `[LatLng](#latlng)` | Creates a [`LatLng`](#latlng) object from an array of 2 numbers (longitude, latitude) or 3 numbers (longitude, latitude, altitude) used in GeoJSON for points. |
| `coordsToLatLngs(<Array> _coords_, <Number> _levelsDeep?_, <Function> _coordsToLatLng?_)` | `Array` | Creates a multidimensional array of [`LatLng`](#latlng)s from a GeoJSON coordinates array. `levelsDeep` specifies the nesting level (0 is for an array of points, 1 for an array of arrays of points, etc., 0 by default). Can use a custom [`coordsToLatLng`](#geojson-coordstolatlng) function. |
| `latLngToCoords(<[LatLng](#latlng)> _latlng_, <Number|false> _precision?_)` | `Array` | Reverse of [`coordsToLatLng`](#geojson-coordstolatlng) Coordinates values are rounded with [`formatNum`](#util-formatnum) function. |
| `latLngsToCoords(<Array> _latlngs_, <Number> _levelsDeep?_, <Boolean> _closed?_, <Number|false> _precision?_)` | `Array` | Reverse of [`coordsToLatLngs`](#geojson-coordstolatlngs) `closed` determines whether the first point should be appended to the end of the array to close the feature, only used when `levelsDeep` is 0. False by default. Coordinates values are rounded with [`formatNum`](#util-formatnum) function. |
| `asFeature(<Object> _geojson_)` | `Object` | Normalize GeoJSON geometries/features into GeoJSON features. |

## GridLayer

Generic class for handling a tiled grid of HTML elements. This is the base class for all tile layers and replaces `TileLayer.Canvas`. GridLayer can be extended to create a tiled grid of HTML elements like `<canvas>`, `<img>` or `<div>`. GridLayer will handle creating and animating these DOM elements for you.

### Usage example

#### Synchronous usage

To create a custom layer, extend GridLayer and implement the `createTile()` method, which will be passed a [`Point`](#point) object with the `x`, `y`, and `z` (zoom level) coordinates to draw your tile.

```javascript
var CanvasLayer = L.GridLayer.extend({
    createTile: function(coords){
        // create a <canvas> element for drawing
        var tile = L.DomUtil.create('canvas', 'leaflet-tile');

        // setup tile width and height according to the options
        var size = this.getTileSize();
        tile.width = size.x;
        tile.height = size.y;

        // get a canvas context and draw something on it using coords.x, coords.y and coords.z
        var ctx = tile.getContext('2d');

        // return the tile so it can be rendered on screen
        return tile;
    }
});
```

#### Asynchronous usage

Tile creation can also be asynchronous, this is useful when using a third-party drawing library. Once the tile is finished drawing it can be passed to the `done()` callback.

```javascript
var CanvasLayer = L.GridLayer.extend({
    createTile: function(coords, done){
        var error;

        // create a <canvas> element for drawing
        var tile = L.DomUtil.create('canvas', 'leaflet-tile');

        // setup tile width and height according to the options
        var size = this.getTileSize();
        tile.width = size.x;
        tile.height = size.y;

        // draw something asynchronously and pass the tile to the done() callback
        setTimeout(function() {
            done(error, tile);
        }, 1000);

        return tile;
    }
});
```

### Creation

| Factory | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `L.gridLayer(<[GridLayer options](#gridlayer-option)> _options?_)` | Creates a new instance of GridLayer with the supplied options. |

### Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tileSize` | `Number|Point` | `256` | Width and height of tiles in the grid. Use a number if width and height are equal, or `L.point(width, height)` otherwise. |
| `opacity` | `Number` | `1.0` | Opacity of the tiles. Can be used in the `createTile()` function. |
| `updateWhenIdle` | `Boolean` | `(depends)` | Load new tiles only when panning ends. `true` by default on mobile browsers, in order to avoid too many requests and keep smooth navigation. `false` otherwise in order to display new tiles _during_ panning, since it is easy to pan outside the [`keepBuffer`](#gridlayer-keepbuffer) option in desktop browsers. |
| `updateWhenZooming` | `Boolean` | `true` | By default, a smooth zoom animation (during a [touch zoom](#map-touchzoom) or a [`flyTo()`](#map-flyto)) will update grid layers every integer zoom level. Setting this option to `false` will update the grid layer only when the smooth animation ends. |
| `updateInterval` | `Number` | `200` | Tiles will not update more than once every `updateInterval` milliseconds when panning. |
| `zIndex` | `Number` | `1` | The explicit zIndex of the tile layer. |
| `bounds` | `[LatLngBounds](#latlngbounds)` | `undefined` | If set, tiles will only be loaded inside the set [`LatLngBounds`](#latlngbounds). |
| `minZoom` | `Number` | `0` | The minimum zoom level down to which this layer will be displayed (inclusive). |
| `maxZoom` | `Number` | `undefined` | The maximum zoom level up to which this layer will be displayed (inclusive). |
| `maxNativeZoom` | `Number` | `undefined` | Maximum zoom number the tile source has available. If it is specified, the tiles on all zoom levels higher than `maxNativeZoom` will be loaded from `maxNativeZoom` level and auto-scaled. |
| `minNativeZoom` | `Number` | `undefined` | Minimum zoom number the tile source has available. If it is specified, the tiles on all zoom levels lower than `minNativeZoom` will be loaded from `minNativeZoom` level and auto-scaled. |
| `noWrap` | `Boolean` | `false` | Whether the layer is wrapped around the antimeridian. If `true`, the GridLayer will only be displayed once at low zoom levels. Has no effect when the [map CRS](#map-crs) doesn't wrap around. Can be used in combination with [`bounds`](#gridlayer-bounds) to prevent requesting tiles outside the CRS limits. |
| `pane` | `String` | `'tilePane'` | `Map pane` where the grid layer will be added. |
| `className` | `String` | `''` | A custom class name to assign to the tile layer. Empty by default. |
| `keepBuffer` | `Number` | `2` | When panning the map, keep this many rows and columns of tiles before unloading them. |

▶ Options inherited from [Layer](#layer)

### Events

| Event | Data | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `loading` | `[Event](#event)` | Fired when the grid layer starts loading tiles. |
| `tileunload` | `[TileEvent](#tileevent)` | Fired when a tile is removed (e.g. when a tile goes off the screen). |
| `tileloadstart` | `[TileEvent](#tileevent)` | Fired when a tile is requested and starts loading. |
| `tileerror` | `[TileErrorEvent](#tileerrorevent)` | Fired when there is an error loading a tile. |

## LatLng

Represents a geographical point with a certain latitude and longitude.

### Usage example

```javascript
var latlng = L.latLng(50.5, 30.5);
```

All Leaflet methods that accept LatLng objects also accept them in a simple Array form and simple object form (unless noted otherwise), so these lines are equivalent:

```plain
map.panTo([50, 30]);
map.panTo({lng: 30, lat: 50});
map.panTo({lat: 50, lng: 30});
map.panTo(L.latLng(50, 30));
```

Note that [`LatLng`](#latlng) does not inherit from Leaflet's [`Class`](#class) object, which means new classes can't inherit from it, and new methods can't be added to it with the `include` function.

### Creation

| Factory | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `L.latLng(<Number> _latitude_, <Number> _longitude_, <Number> _altitude?_)` | Creates an object representing a geographical point with the given latitude and longitude (and optionally altitude). |
| `L.latLng(<Array> _coords_)` | Expects an array of the form `[Number, Number]` or `[Number, Number, Number]` instead. |
| `L.latLng(<Object> _coords_)` | Expects an plain object of the form `{lat: Number, lng: Number}` or `{lat: Number, lng: Number, alt: Number}` instead. |

### Methods

| Method | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `equals(<[LatLng](#latlng)> _otherLatLng_, <Number> _maxMargin?_)` | `Boolean` ||
|Returns `true` if the given [`LatLng`](#latlng) point is at the same position (within a small margin of error). The margin of error can be overridden by setting `maxMargin` to a small number.|||

 |
| `toString()` | `String` | 

Returns a string representation of the point (for debugging purposes).

 |
| `distanceTo(<[LatLng](#latlng)> _otherLatLng_)` | `Number` | 

Returns the distance (in meters) to the given [`LatLng`](#latlng) calculated using the [Spherical Law of Cosines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_law_of_cosines).

 |
| `wrap()` | `[LatLng](#latlng)` | 

Returns a new [`LatLng`](#latlng) object with the longitude wrapped so it's always between -180 and +180 degrees.

 |
| `toBounds(<Number> _sizeInMeters_)` | `[LatLngBounds](#latlngbounds)` | 

Returns a new [`LatLngBounds`](#latlngbounds) object in which each boundary is `sizeInMeters/2` meters apart from the [`LatLng`](#latlng).

 |

### Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lat` | `Number` | Latitude in degrees |
| `lng` | `Number` | Longitude in degrees |
| `alt` | `Number` | Altitude in meters (optional) |

## LatLngBounds

Represents a rectangular geographical area on a map.

### Usage example

```javascript
var corner1 = L.latLng(40.712, -74.227),
corner2 = L.latLng(40.774, -74.125),
bounds = L.latLngBounds(corner1, corner2);
```

All Leaflet methods that accept LatLngBounds objects also accept them in a simple Array form (unless noted otherwise), so the bounds example above can be passed like this:

```javascript
map.fitBounds([
    [40.712, -74.227],
    [40.774, -74.125]
]);
```

Caution: if the area crosses the antimeridian (often confused with the International Date Line), you must specify corners _outside_ the \[-180, 180\] degrees longitude range.

Note that [`LatLngBounds`](#latlngbounds) does not inherit from Leaflet's [`Class`](#class) object, which means new classes can't inherit from it, and new methods can't be added to it with the `include` function.

## Point

Represents a point with `x` and `y` coordinates in pixels.

### Usage example

```javascript
var point = L.point(200, 300);
```

All Leaflet methods and options that accept [`Point`](#point) objects also accept them in a simple Array form (unless noted otherwise), so these lines are equivalent:

```javascript
map.panBy([200, 300]);
map.panBy(L.point(200, 300));
```

Note that [`Point`](#point) does not inherit from Leaflet's [`Class`](#class) object, which means new classes can't inherit from it, and new methods can't be added to it with the `include` function.

### Creation

| Factory | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `L.point(<Number> _x_, <Number> _y_, <Boolean> _round?_)` | Creates a Point object with the given `x` and `y` coordinates. If optional `round` is set to true, rounds the `x` and `y` values. |
| `L.point(<Number[]> _coords_)` | Expects an array of the form `[x, y]` instead. |
| `L.point(<Object> _coords_)` | Expects a plain object of the form `{x: Number, y: Number}` instead. |

 |
| `unscaleBy(<[Point](#point)> _scale_)` | `[Point](#point)` | 

Inverse of `scaleBy`. Divide each coordinate of the current point by each coordinate of `scale`.

 |

## Bounds

Represents a rectangular area in pixel coordinates.

### Usage example

```javascript
var p1 = L.point(10, 10),
p2 = L.point(40, 60),
bounds = L.bounds(p1, p2);
```

All Leaflet methods that accept [`Bounds`](#bounds) objects also accept them in a simple Array form (unless noted otherwise), so the bounds example above can be passed like this:

```javascript
otherBounds.intersects([[10, 10], [40, 60]]);
```

Note that [`Bounds`](#bounds) does not inherit from Leaflet's [`Class`](#class) object, which means new classes can't inherit from it, and new methods can't be added to it with the `include` function.

### Icon.Default

A trivial subclass of [`Icon`](#icon), represents the icon to use in [`Marker`](#marker)s when no icon is specified. Points to the blue marker image distributed with Leaflet releases.

In order to customize the default icon, just change the properties of `L.Icon.Default.prototype.options` (which is a set of [`Icon options`](#icon-option)).

If you want to _completely_ replace the default icon, override the `L.Marker.prototype.options.icon` with your own icon instead.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `imagePath` | `String` |  | [`Icon.Default`](#icon-default) will try to auto-detect the location of the blue icon images. If you are placing these images in a non-standard way, set this option to point to the right path. |

## DivIcon

Represents a lightweight icon for markers that uses a simple `<div>` element instead of an image. Inherits from [`Icon`](#icon) but ignores the `iconUrl` and shadow options.

### Usage example

```javascript
var myIcon = L.divIcon({className: 'my-div-icon'});
// you can set .my-div-icon styles in CSS

L.marker([50.505, 30.57], {icon: myIcon}).addTo(map);
```

By default, it has a 'leaflet-div-icon' CSS class and is styled as a little white square with a shadow.

### Creation

## Control.Layers

The layers control gives users the ability to switch between different base layers and switch overlays on/off (check out the [detailed example](https://leafletjs.com/examples/layers-control/)). Extends [`Control`](#control).

### Usage example

```javascript
var baseLayers = {
    "Mapbox": mapbox,
    "OpenStreetMap": osm
};

var overlays = {
    "Marker": marker,
    "Roads": roadsLayer
};

L.control.layers(baseLayers, overlays).addTo(map);
```

The `baseLayers` and `overlays` parameters are object literals with layer names as keys and [`Layer`](#layer) objects as values:

```javascript
{
    "<someName1>": layer1,
    "<someName2>": layer2
}
```

The layer names can contain HTML, which allows you to add additional styling to the items:

```javascript
{"<img src='my-layer-icon' /> <span class='my-layer-item'>My Layer</span>": myLayer}
```

### Creation

| Factory | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `L.control.layers(<Object> _baselayers?_, <Object> _overlays?_, <[Control.Layers options](#control-layers-option)> _options?_)` | Creates a layers control with the given layers. Base layers will be switched with radio buttons, while overlays will be switched with checkboxes. Note that all base layers should be passed in the base layers object, but only one should be added to the map during map instantiation. |

### Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |

| `hideSingleBase` | `Boolean` | `false` | If `true`, the base layers in the control will be hidden when there is only one. |
| `sortLayers` | `Boolean` | `false` | Whether to sort the layers. When `false`, layers will keep the order in which they were added to the control. |
| `sortFunction` | `Function` | `*` | A [compare function](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) that will be used for sorting the layers, when `sortLayers` is `true`. The function receives both the [`L.Layer`](#layer) instances and their names, as in `sortFunction(layerA, layerB, nameA, nameB)`. By default, it sorts layers alphabetically by their name. |

| `getParamString(<Object> _obj_, <String> _existingUrl?_, <Boolean> _uppercase?_)` | `String` | Converts an object into a parameter URL string, e.g. `{a: "foo", b: "bar"}` translates to `'?a=foo&b=bar'`. If `existingUrl` is set, the parameters will be appended at the end. If `uppercase` is `true`, the parameter names will be uppercased (e.g. `'?A=foo&B=bar'`) |
| `template(<String> _str_, <Object> _data_)` | `String` | Simple templating facility, accepts a template string of the form `'Hello {a}, {b}'` and a data object like `{a: 'foo', b: 'bar'}`, returns evaluated string `('Hello foo, bar')`. You can also specify functions instead of strings for data values — they will be evaluated passing `data` as an argument. |

| `indexOf(<Array> _array_, <Object> _el_)` | `Number` | Compatibility polyfill for [Array.prototype.indexOf](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf) |
| `requestAnimFrame(<Function> _fn_, <Object> _context?_, <Boolean> _immediate?_)` | `Number` | Schedules `fn` to be executed when the browser repaints. `fn` is bound to `context` if given. When `immediate` is set, `fn` is called immediately if the browser doesn't have native support for [`window.requestAnimationFrame`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame), otherwise it's delayed. Returns a request ID that can be used to cancel the request. |
| `cancelAnimFrame(<Number> _id_)` | `undefined` | Cancels a previous `requestAnimFrame`. See also [window.cancelAnimationFrame](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/window/cancelAnimationFrame). |

### Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lastId` | `Number` | Last unique ID used by [`stamp()`](#util-stamp) |
| `emptyImageUrl` | `String` | Data URI string containing a base64-encoded empty GIF image. Used as a hack to free memory from unused images on WebKit-powered mobile devices (by setting image `src` to this string). |

## Transformation

Represents an affine transformation: a set of coefficients `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` for transforming a point of a form `(x, y)` into `(a*x + b, c*y + d)` and doing the reverse. Used by Leaflet in its projections code.

### Usage example

```javascript
var transformation = L.transformation(2, 5, -1, 10),
    p = L.point(1, 2),
    p2 = transformation.transform(p), //  L.point(7, 8)
    p3 = transformation.untransform(p2); //  L.point(1, 2)
```

### Creation

| Factory | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `L.transformation(<Number> _a_, <Number> _b_, <Number> _c_, <Number> _d_)` | Instantiates a Transformation object with the given coefficients. |
| `L.transformation(<Array> _coefficients_)` | Expects an coefficients array of the form `[a: Number, b: Number, c: Number, d: Number]`. |

### Methods

| Method | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `transform(<[Point](#point)> _point_, <Number> _scale?_)` | `[Point](#point)` ||
|Returns a transformed point, optionally multiplied by the given scale. Only accepts actual [`L.Point`](#point) instances, not arrays.|||

 |
| `untransform(<[Point](#point)> _point_, <Number> _scale?_)` | `[Point](#point)` | 

Returns the reverse transformation of the given point, optionally divided by the given scale. Only accepts actual [`L.Point`](#point) instances, not arrays.

## LineUtil

Various utility functions for polyline points processing, used by Leaflet internally to make polylines lightning-fast.

### Functions

| Function | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `simplify(<Point[]> _points_, <Number> _tolerance_)` | `Point[]` | Dramatically reduces the number of points in a polyline while retaining its shape and returns a new array of simplified points, using the [Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramer-Douglas-Peucker_algorithm). Used for a huge performance boost when processing/displaying Leaflet polylines for each zoom level and also reducing visual noise. tolerance affects the amount of simplification (lesser value means higher quality but slower and with more points). Also released as a separated micro-library [Simplify.js](https://mourner.github.io/simplify-js/). |
| `pointToSegmentDistance(<[Point](#point)> _p_, <[Point](#point)> _p1_, <[Point](#point)> _p2_)` | `Number` | Returns the distance between point `p` and segment `p1` to `p2`. |
| `closestPointOnSegment(<[Point](#point)> _p_, <[Point](#point)> _p1_, <[Point](#point)> _p2_)` | `Number` | Returns the closest point from a point `p` on a segment `p1` to `p2`. |
| `clipSegment(<[Point](#point)> _a_, <[Point](#point)> _b_, <[Bounds](#bounds)> _bounds_, <Boolean> _useLastCode?_, <Boolean> _round?_)` | `Point[]|Boolean` | Clips the segment a to b by rectangular bounds with the [Cohen-Sutherland algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen%E2%80%93Sutherland_algorithm) (modifying the segment points directly!). Used by Leaflet to only show polyline points that are on the screen or near, increasing performance. |
| `isFlat(<LatLng[]> _latlngs_)` | `Boolean` | Returns true if `latlngs` is a flat array, false is nested. |
| `polylineCenter(<LatLng[]> _latlngs_, <[CRS](#crs)> _crs_)` | `[LatLng](#latlng)` | Returns the center ([centroid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centroid)) of the passed LatLngs (first ring) from a polyline. |

Used by Leaflet to only show polygon points that are on the screen or near, increasing performance. Note that polygon points needs different algorithm for clipping than polyline, so there's a separate method for it. |
| `polygonCenter(<LatLng[]> _latlngs_, <[CRS](#crs)> _crs_)` | `[LatLng](#latlng)` | Returns the center ([centroid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centroid)) of the passed LatLngs (first ring) from a polygon. |

| --- | --- | --- |
| `on(<HTMLElement> _el_, <String> _types_, <Function> _fn_, <Object> _context?_)` | `this` | Adds a listener function (`fn`) to a particular DOM event type of the element `el`. You can optionally specify the context of the listener (object the `this` keyword will point to). You can also pass several space-separated types (e.g. `'click dblclick'`). |
| `on(<HTMLElement> _el_, <Object> _eventMap_, <Object> _context?_)` | `this` | Adds a set of type/listener pairs, e.g. `{click: onClick, mousemove: onMouseMove}` |
| `off(<HTMLElement> _el_, <String> _types_, <Function> _fn_, <Object> _context?_)` | `this` | Removes a previously added listener function. Note that if you passed a custom context to on, you must pass the same context to `off` in order to remove the listener. |

| `stop(<DOMEvent> _ev_)` | `this` | Does `stopPropagation` and `preventDefault` at the same time. |
| `getPropagationPath(<DOMEvent> _ev_)` | `Array` | Compatibility polyfill for [`Event.composedPath()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/composedPath). Returns an array containing the `HTMLElement`s that the given DOM event should propagate to (if not stopped). |
| `getMousePosition(<DOMEvent> _ev_, <HTMLElement> _container?_)` | `[Point](#point)` | Gets normalized mouse position from a DOM event relative to the `container` (border excluded) or to the whole page if not specified. |
| `getWheelDelta(<DOMEvent> _ev_)` | `Number` | Gets normalized wheel delta from a wheel DOM event, in vertical pixels scrolled (negative if scrolling down). Events from pointing devices without precise scrolling are mapped to a best guess of 60 pixels. |
| `addListener(_…_)` | `this` | Alias to [`L.DomEvent.on`](#domevent-on) |
| `removeListener(_…_)` | `this` | Alias to [`L.DomEvent.off`](#domevent-off) |

## DomUtil

Utility functions to work with the [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) tree, used by Leaflet internally.

Most functions expecting or returning a `HTMLElement` also work for SVG elements. The only difference is that classes refer to CSS classes in HTML and SVG classes in SVG.

### Functions

| Function | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |

| `getPosition(<HTMLElement> _el_)` | `[Point](#point)` | Returns the coordinates of an element previously positioned with setPosition. |
| `disableTextSelection()` |  | Prevents the user from generating `selectstart` DOM events, usually generated when the user drags the mouse through a page with text. Used internally by Leaflet to override the behaviour of any click-and-drag interaction on the map. Affects drag interactions on the whole document. |
| `enableTextSelection()` |  | Cancels the effects of a previous [`L.DomUtil.disableTextSelection`](#domutil-disabletextselection). |
| `disableImageDrag()` |  | As [`L.DomUtil.disableTextSelection`](#domutil-disabletextselection), but for `dragstart` DOM events, usually generated when the user drags an image. |

| `restoreOutline()` |  | Cancels the effects of a previous `L.DomUtil.preventOutline`. |
| `getSizedParentNode(<HTMLElement> _el_)` | `HTMLElement` | Finds the closest parent node which size (width and height) is not null. |
| `getScale(<HTMLElement> _el_)` | `Object` | Computes the CSS scale currently applied on the element. Returns an object with `x` and `y` members as horizontal and vertical scales respectively, and `boundingClientRect` as the result of [`getBoundingClientRect()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect). |

### Properties

## Class

L.Class powers the OOP facilities of Leaflet and is used to create almost all of the Leaflet classes documented here.

In addition to implementing a simple classical inheritance model, it introduces several special properties for convenient code organization — options, includes and statics.

### Usage example

```javascript
var MyClass = L.Class.extend({
initialize: function (greeter) {
    this.greeter = greeter;
    // class constructor
},

greet: function (name) {
    alert(this.greeter + ', ' + name)
    }
});

// create instance of MyClass, passing "Hello" to the constructor
var a = new MyClass("Hello");

// call greet method, alerting "Hello, World"
a.greet("World");
```

#### Class Factories

You may have noticed that Leaflet objects are created without using the `new` keyword. This is achieved by complementing each class with a lowercase factory method:

```javascript
new L.Map('map'); // becomes:
L.map('map');
```

The factories are implemented very easily, and you can do this for your own classes:

```javascript
L.map = function (id, options) {
    return new L.Map(id, options);
};
```

#### Inheritance

You use L.Class.extend to define new classes, but you can use the same method on any class to inherit from it:

```javascript
var MyChildClass = MyClass.extend({
    // ... new properties and methods
});
```

This will create a class that inherits all methods and properties of the parent class (through a proper prototype chain), adding or overriding the ones you pass to extend. It will also properly react to instanceof:

```javascript
var a = new MyChildClass();
a instanceof MyChildClass; // true
a instanceof MyClass; // true
```

You can call parent methods (including constructor) from corresponding child ones (as you do with super calls in other languages) by accessing parent class prototype and using JavaScript's call or apply:

```javascript
var MyChildClass = MyClass.extend({
    initialize: function () {
        MyClass.prototype.initialize.call(this, "Yo");
    },

    greet: function (name) {
        MyClass.prototype.greet.call(this, 'bro ' + name + '!');
    }
});

var a = new MyChildClass();
a.greet('Jason'); // alerts "Yo, bro Jason!"
```

#### Options

`options` is a special property that unlike other objects that you pass to `extend` will be merged with the parent one instead of overriding it completely, which makes managing configuration of objects and default values convenient:

```javascript
var MyClass = L.Class.extend({
    options: {
        myOption1: 'foo',
        myOption2: 'bar'
    }
});

var MyChildClass = MyClass.extend({
    options: {
        myOption1: 'baz',
        myOption3: 5
    }
});

var a = new MyChildClass();
a.options.myOption1; // 'baz'
a.options.myOption2; // 'bar'
a.options.myOption3; // 5
```

There's also [`L.Util.setOptions`](#util-setoptions), a method for conveniently merging options passed to constructor with the defaults defines in the class:

```javascript
var MyClass = L.Class.extend({
    options: {
        foo: 'bar',
        bla: 5
    },

    initialize: function (options) {
        L.Util.setOptions(this, options);
        ...
    }
});

var a = new MyClass({bla: 10});
a.options; // {foo: 'bar', bla: 10}
```

Note that the options object allows any keys, not just the options defined by the class and its base classes. This means you can use the options object to store application specific information, as long as you avoid keys that are already used by the class in question.

#### Includes

`includes` is a special class property that merges all specified objects into the class (such objects are called mixins).

```javascript
 var MyMixin = {
    foo: function () { ... },
    bar: 5
};

var MyClass = L.Class.extend({
    includes: MyMixin
});

var a = new MyClass();
a.foo();
```

You can also do such includes in runtime with the `include` method:

```javascript
MyClass.include(MyMixin);
```

`statics` is just a convenience property that injects specified object properties as the static properties of the class, useful for defining constants:

```javascript
var MyClass = L.Class.extend({
    statics: {
        FOO: 'bar',
        BLA: 5
    }
});

MyClass.FOO; // 'bar'
```

#### Constructor hooks

If you're a plugin developer, you often need to add additional initialization code to existing classes (e.g. editing hooks for [`L.Polyline`](#polyline)). Leaflet comes with a way to do it easily using the `addInitHook` method:

```javascript
MyClass.addInitHook(function () {
    // ... do something in constructor additionally
    // e.g. add event listeners, set custom properties etc.
});
```

You can also use the following shortcut when you just need to make one additional method call:

```javascript
MyClass.addInitHook('methodName', arg1, arg2, …);
```

### Functions

| Function | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `extend(<Object> _props_)` | `Function` | [Extends the current class](#class-inheritance) given the properties to be included. Returns a Javascript function that is a class constructor (to be called with `new`). |
| `include(<Object> _properties_)` | `this` | [Includes a mixin](#class-includes) into the current class. |
| `mergeOptions(<Object> _options_)` | `this` | [Merges `options`](#class-options) into the defaults of the class. |
| `addInitHook(<Function> _fn_)` | `this` | Adds a [constructor hook](#class-constructor-hooks) to the class. |

## Evented

A set of methods shared between event-powered classes (like [`Map`](#map) and [`Marker`](#marker)). Generally, events allow you to execute some function when something happens with an object (e.g. the user clicks on the map, causing the map to fire `'click'` event).

### Usage example

```javascript
map.on('click', function(e) {
    alert(e.latlng);
} );
```

Leaflet deals with event listeners by reference, so if you want to add a listener and then remove it, define it as a function:

```javascript
function onClick(e) { ... }

map.on('click', onClick);
map.off('click', onClick);
```

### Methods

| Method | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `on(<String> _type_, <Function> _fn_, <Object> _context?_)` | `this` ||
|Adds a listener function (`fn`) to a particular event type of the object. You can optionally specify the context of the listener (object the this keyword will point to). You can also pass several space-separated types (e.g. `'click dblclick'`).|||

 |
| `on(<Object> _eventMap_)` | `this` | 

Adds a set of type/listener pairs, e.g. `{click: onClick, mousemove: onMouseMove}`

 |
| `off(<String> _type_, <Function> _fn?_, <Object> _context?_)` | `this` | 

Removes a previously added listener function. If no function is specified, it will remove all the listeners of that particular event from the object. Note that if you passed a custom context to `on`, you must pass the same context to `off` in order to remove the listener.

 |
| `off(<Object> _eventMap_)` | `this` | 

Removes a set of type/listener pairs.

 |
| `off()` | `this` | 

Removes all listeners to all events on the object. This includes implicitly attached events.

 |
| `fire(<String> _type_, <Object> _data?_, <Boolean> _propagate?_)` | `this` | 

Fires an event of the specified type. You can optionally provide a data object — the first argument of the listener function will contain its properties. The event can optionally be propagated to event parents.

 |
| `listens(<String> _type_, <Boolean> _propagate?_)` | `Boolean` | 

Returns `true` if a particular event type has any listeners attached to it. The verification can optionally be propagated, it will return `true` if parents have the listener attached to it.

 |
| `once(_…_)` | `this` | 

Behaves as [`on(…)`](#evented-on), except the listener will only get fired once and then removed.

 |
| `addEventParent(<[Evented](#evented)> _obj_)` | `this` | 

Adds an event parent - an [`Evented`](#evented) that will receive propagated events

 |
| `removeEventParent(<[Evented](#evented)> _obj_)` | `this` | 

Removes an event parent, so it will stop receiving propagated events

 |
| `addEventListener(_…_)` | `this` | 

Alias to [`on(…)`](#evented-on)

 |
| `removeEventListener(_…_)` | `this` | 

Alias to [`off(…)`](#evented-off)

 |
| `clearAllEventListeners(_…_)` | `this` | 

Alias to [`off()`](#evented-off)

 |
| `addOneTimeEventListener(_…_)` | `this` | 

Alias to [`once(…)`](#evented-once)

 |
| `fireEvent(_…_)` | `this` | 

Alias to [`fire(…)`](#evented-fire)

 |
| `hasEventListeners(_…_)` | `Boolean` | 

Alias to [`listens(…)`](#evented-listens)

 |

## Layer

A set of methods from the Layer base class that all Leaflet layers use. Inherits all methods, options and events from [`L.Evented`](#evented).

### Usage example

```javascript
var layer = L.marker(latlng).addTo(map);
layer.addTo(map);
layer.remove();
```

### Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pane` | `String` | `'overlayPane'` | By default the layer will be added to the map's [overlay pane](#map-overlaypane). Overriding this option will cause the layer to be placed on another pane by default. |
| `attribution` | `String` | `null` | String to be shown in the attribution control, e.g. "© OpenStreetMap contributors". It describes the layer data and is often a legal obligation towards copyright holders and tile providers. |

### Events

| Event | Data | Description |

## Projection

An object with methods for projecting geographical coordinates of the world onto a flat surface (and back). See [Map projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection).

### Methods

| Method | Returns | Description |

The inverse of `project`. Projects a 2D point into a geographical location. Only accepts actual [`L.Point`](#point) instances, not arrays.

Note that the projection instances do not inherit from Leaflet's [`Class`](#class) object, and can't be instantiated. Also, new classes can't inherit from them, and methods can't be added to them with the `include` function.

 |

### Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bounds` | `[Bounds](#bounds)` | The bounds (specified in CRS units) where the projection is valid |

### Defined projections

Leaflet comes with a set of already defined Projections out of the box:

| Projection | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `L.Projection.LonLat` | Equirectangular, or Plate Carree projection — the most simple projection, mostly used by GIS enthusiasts. Directly maps `x` as longitude, and `y` as latitude. Also suitable for flat worlds, e.g. game maps. Used by the `EPSG:4326` and `Simple` CRS. |
| `L.Projection.Mercator` | Elliptical Mercator projection — more complex than Spherical Mercator. Assumes that Earth is an ellipsoid. Used by the EPSG:3395 CRS. |
| `L.Projection.SphericalMercator` | Spherical Mercator projection — the most common projection for online maps, used by almost all free and commercial tile providers. Assumes that Earth is a sphere. Used by the `EPSG:3857` CRS. |

## CRS

### Methods

| Method | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `latLngToPoint(<[LatLng](#latlng)> _latlng_, <Number> _zoom_)` | `[Point](#point)` ||
|Projects geographical coordinates into pixel coordinates for a given zoom.|||

 |
| `pointToLatLng(<[Point](#point)> _point_, <Number> _zoom_)` | `[LatLng](#latlng)` | 

The inverse of `latLngToPoint`. Projects pixel coordinates on a given zoom into geographical coordinates.

 |
| `project(<[LatLng](#latlng)> _latlng_)` | `[Point](#point)` | 

Projects geographical coordinates into coordinates in units accepted for this CRS (e.g. meters for EPSG:3857, for passing it to WMS services).

 |
| `unproject(<[Point](#point)> _point_)` | `[LatLng](#latlng)` | 

Given a projected coordinate returns the corresponding LatLng. The inverse of `project`.

 |
| `scale(<Number> _zoom_)` | `Number` | 

Returns the scale used when transforming projected coordinates into pixel coordinates for a particular zoom. For example, it returns `256 * 2^zoom` for Mercator-based CRS.

 |
| `zoom(<Number> _scale_)` | `Number` | 

Inverse of `scale()`, returns the zoom level corresponding to a scale factor of `scale`.

 |
| `getProjectedBounds(<Number> _zoom_)` | `[Bounds](#bounds)` | 

Returns the projection's bounds scaled and transformed for the provided `zoom`.

 |
| `distance(<[LatLng](#latlng)> _latlng1_, <[LatLng](#latlng)> _latlng2_)` | `Number` | 

Returns the distance between two geographical coordinates.

 |
| `wrapLatLng(<[LatLng](#latlng)> _latlng_)` | `[LatLng](#latlng)` | 

Returns a [`LatLng`](#latlng) where lat and lng has been wrapped according to the CRS's `wrapLat` and `wrapLng` properties, if they are outside the CRS's bounds.

 |
| `wrapLatLngBounds(<[LatLngBounds](#latlngbounds)> _bounds_)` | `[LatLngBounds](#latlngbounds)` | 

Returns a [`LatLngBounds`](#latlngbounds) with the same size as the given one, ensuring that its center is within the CRS's bounds. Only accepts actual [`L.LatLngBounds`](#latlngbounds) instances, not arrays.

 |

### Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `code` | `String` | Standard code name of the CRS passed into WMS services (e.g. `'EPSG:3857'`) |
| `wrapLng` | `Number[]` | An array of two numbers defining whether the longitude (horizontal) coordinate axis wraps around a given range and how. Defaults to `[-180, 180]` in most geographical CRSs. If `undefined`, the longitude axis does not wrap around. |
| `wrapLat` | `Number[]` | Like `wrapLng`, but for the latitude (vertical) axis. |
| `infinite` | `Boolean` | If true, the coordinate space will be unbounded (infinite in both axes) |

### Defined CRSs

| CRS | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `L.CRS.Earth` | Serves as the base for CRS that are global such that they cover the earth. Can only be used as the base for other CRS and cannot be used directly, since it does not have a `code`, `projection` or `transformation`. `distance()` returns meters. |
| `L.CRS.EPSG3395` | Rarely used by some commercial tile providers. Uses Elliptical Mercator projection. |
| `L.CRS.EPSG3857` | The most common CRS for online maps, used by almost all free and commercial tile providers. Uses Spherical Mercator projection. Set in by default in Map's `crs` option. |
| `L.CRS.EPSG4326` | A common CRS among GIS enthusiasts. Uses simple Equirectangular projection.|
|Leaflet 1.0.x complies with the [TMS coordinate scheme for EPSG:4326](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Tile_Map_Service_Specification#global-geodetic), which is a breaking change from 0.7.x behaviour. If you are using a [`TileLayer`](#tilelayer) with this CRS, ensure that there are two 256x256 pixel tiles covering the whole earth at zoom level zero, and that the tile coordinate origin is (-180,+90), or (-180,-90) for [`TileLayer`](#tilelayer)s with [the `tms` option](#tilelayer-tms) set.||

 |
| `L.CRS.Base` | Object that defines coordinate reference systems for projecting geographical points into pixel (screen) coordinates and back (and to coordinates in other units for [WMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Service) services). See [spatial reference system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_reference_system).

Leaflet defines the most usual CRSs by default. If you want to use a CRS not defined by default, take a look at the [Proj4Leaflet](https://github.com/kartena/Proj4Leaflet) plugin.

Note that the CRS instances do not inherit from Leaflet's [`Class`](#class) object, and can't be instantiated. Also, new classes can't inherit from them, and methods can't be added to them with the `include` function.

 |
| `L.CRS.Simple` | A simple CRS that maps longitude and latitude into `x` and `y` directly. May be used for maps of flat surfaces (e.g. game maps). Note that the `y` axis should still be inverted (going from bottom to top). `distance()` returns simple euclidean distance. |

## Renderer

Base class for vector renderer implementations ([`SVG`](#svg), [`Canvas`](#canvas)). Handles the DOM container of the renderer, its bounds, and its zoom animation.

A [`Renderer`](#renderer) works as an implicit layer group for all [`Path`](#path)s - the renderer itself can be added or removed to the map. All paths use a renderer, which can be implicit (the map will decide the type of renderer and use it automatically) or explicit (using the [`renderer`](#path-renderer) option of the path).

Do not use this class directly, use [`SVG`](#svg) and [`Canvas`](#canvas) instead.

### Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `padding` | `Number` | `0.1` | How much to extend the clip area around the map view (relative to its size) e.g. 0.1 would be 10% of map view in each direction |

▶ Options inherited from [Layer](#layer)

### Events

| Event | Data | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `update` | `[Event](#event)` | Fired when the renderer updates its bounds, center and zoom, for example when its map has moved |

## Event objects

Whenever a class inheriting from [`Evented`](#evented) fires an event, a listener function will be called with an event argument, which is a plain object containing information about the event. For example:

```javascript
map.on('click', function(ev) {
    alert(ev.latlng); // ev is an event object (MouseEvent in this case)
});
```

The information available depends on the event type:

### Event

## Global Switches

Global switches are created for rare cases and generally make Leaflet to not detect a particular browser feature even if it's there. You need to set the switch as a global variable to true before including Leaflet on the page, like this:

```xml
<script>L_NO_TOUCH = true;</script>
<script src="leaflet.js"></script>
```

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `L_NO_TOUCH` | Forces Leaflet to not use touch events even if it detects them. |
| `L_DISABLE_3D` | Forces Leaflet to not use hardware-accelerated CSS 3D transforms for positioning (which may cause glitches in some rare environments) even if they're supported. |

## noConflict

This method restores the `L` global variable to the original value it had before Leaflet inclusion, and returns the real Leaflet namespace so you can put it elsewhere, like this:

```xml
<script src='libs/l.js'>
<!-- L points to some other library -->

<script src='leaflet.js'>
<!-- you include Leaflet, it replaces the L variable to Leaflet namespace -->

<script>
var Leaflet = L.noConflict();
// now L points to that other library again, and you can use Leaflet.Map etc.
</script>
```

## version

A constant that represents the Leaflet version in use.

```javascript
L.version; // contains "1.0.0" (or whatever version is currently in use)
```
